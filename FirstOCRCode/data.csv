./dataset\a04-092-s00-00.png,There are three kinds of reasons that justify

./dataset\a04-096-s00-00.png,The second reason is concerned with doubts

./dataset\a04-096-s01-00.png,He argues that

./dataset\c06-138-s00-10.png,era .
./dataset\d01-016-s00-00.png,The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
./dataset\d01-016-s00-01.png,the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
./dataset\d01-016-s00-02.png,"plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote ."
./dataset\d01-016-s01-00.png,The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
./dataset\d01-019-s00-00.png,There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
./dataset\d01-019-s00-01.png,Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations .
./dataset\d01-019-s01-00.png,The
./dataset\d01-019-s01-01.png,present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history .
./dataset\d01-019-s02-00.png,The
./dataset\d01-019-s02-01.png,"original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was"
./dataset\d01-019-s02-02.png,accidentally damaged .
./dataset\d01-019-s03-00.png,"An editor , who was not the author , made what he"
./dataset\d01-019-s03-01.png,"could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order ."
./dataset\d01-024-s00-00.png,Most of those who expound a theory of textual
./dataset\d01-024-s00-01.png,dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
./dataset\d01-024-s00-02.png,written entirely by one author before the
./dataset\d01-024-s00-03.png,disturbance took place but a few leave it open
./dataset\d01-024-s00-04.png,to suppose that the original book had been
./dataset\d01-024-s00-05.png,revised even before the upheaval .
./dataset\d01-024-s01-00.png,The ingenuity
./dataset\d01-024-s01-01.png,of the theories is impressive and is the best

./dataset\d01-049-s00-01.png,"case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,"
./dataset\d01-049-s00-02.png,"he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly"
./dataset\d01-049-s00-03.png,how this enlargement was effected nor has he
./dataset\d01-049-s00-04.png,been able to explain the textual movements by
./dataset\d01-049-s00-05.png,showing that such changes are part of a
./dataset\d01-049-s00-06.png,simple and coherent plan .
./dataset\d01-049-s01-00.png,To understand how
./dataset\d01-049-s01-01.png,this is possible it is necessary to examine the
./dataset\d01-049-s01-02.png,text of the Gospel .
./dataset\d01-052-s00-00.png,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
./dataset\d01-052-s00-01.png,written in Greek .
./dataset\d01-052-s01-00.png,A modern text of the
./dataset\d01-052-s01-01.png,Gospel represents the work of generations of
./dataset\d01-052-s01-02.png,scholars who have compared the many manu-
./dataset\d01-052-s01-03.png,scripts of John and worked out the version
./dataset\d01-052-s01-04.png,which is most likely to have been the original
./dataset\d01-052-s01-05.png,wording .
./dataset\d01-052-s02-00.png,It is not possible to establish any one
./dataset\d01-052-s02-01.png,text with absolute precision .
./dataset\d01-056-s00-00.png,The most convenient one for the authors
./dataset\d01-056-s00-01.png,has been the text of A. Souter .
./dataset\d01-056-s01-00.png,In this
./dataset\d01-056-s01-01.png,version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
./dataset\d01-056-s01-02.png,"printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,"
./dataset\d01-056-s01-03.png,"verbs , and other parts of speech occurring"
./dataset\d01-056-s01-05.png,forms .
./dataset\d01-056-s02-00.png,There are other texts which could
./dataset\d01-056-s02-01.png,"have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )"
./dataset\d01-056-s02-02.png,it is not a matter of the greatest importance
./dataset\d01-056-s02-03.png,which text is used .
./dataset\d01-060-s00-00.png,At first sight the difference between
./dataset\d01-060-s00-01.png,Souter and the other texts is rather
./dataset\d01-060-s00-02.png,large .
./dataset\d01-060-s01-00.png,But the British text includes
./dataset\d01-060-s01-01.png,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman"
./dataset\d01-060-s01-02.png,"taken in Adultery , and this accounts"
./dataset\d01-060-s01-03.png,"for 178 words out of 279 , which is"
./dataset\d01-060-s01-04.png,"the difference between the 15,695 words"
./dataset\d01-060-s01-05.png,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's ."
./dataset\d01-060-s02-00.png,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
./dataset\d01-060-s02-01.png,is a matter of editorial decision rather
./dataset\d01-080-s00-00.png,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
./dataset\d01-080-s00-01.png,were also used .
./dataset\d01-080-s01-00.png,Dots sometimes served in place of the
./dataset\d01-080-s01-01.png,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
./dataset\d01-080-s01-02.png,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending .
./dataset\d01-080-s02-00.png,Frequently
./dataset\d01-080-s02-01.png,paragraphos markings were omitted .
./dataset\d01-080-s03-00.png,C. H. Roberts is of
./dataset\d01-080-s03-01.png,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
./dataset\d01-080-s03-02.png,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
./dataset\d01-080-s03-03.png,impossible to say .
./dataset\d01-085-s00-01.png,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked .
./dataset\d01-085-s01-00.png,The
./dataset\d01-085-s01-01.png,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
./dataset\d01-085-s01-02.png,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
./dataset\d01-085-s01-03.png,columns .
./dataset\d01-085-s02-00.png,This is the invariable practice of ancient
./dataset\d01-085-s02-01.png,manuscripts .
./dataset\d01-085-s03-00.png,A common size of column would hold
./dataset\d01-098-s00-00.png,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
./dataset\d01-098-s01-01.png,a simple and serviceable book .
./dataset\d01-098-s02-00.png,It was robust - the number
./dataset\d01-098-s02-01.png,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
./dataset\d01-098-s02-02.png,this - and it was easily stored .
./dataset\d01-098-s03-00.png,It had two disadvantages .
./dataset\d01-098-s04-00.png,It
./dataset\d01-098-s04-01.png,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
./dataset\d01-104-s00-00.png,This last objection might have had some weight in
./dataset\d01-104-s00-01.png,ecclesiastical circles .
./dataset\d01-104-s01-00.png,"In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
./dataset\d01-104-s01-01.png,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
./dataset\d01-104-s02-00.png,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
./dataset\d01-104-s02-01.png,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
./dataset\d01-104-s02-02.png,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
./dataset\d01-104-s03-00.png,The other form of book was the codex .
./dataset\d01-104-s04-00.png,In this the
./dataset\d01-104-s04-01.png,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
./dataset\d01-118-s00-00.png,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
./dataset\d01-118-s00-01.png,might be bulky .
./dataset\d01-118-s01-00.png,It is sometimes possible to tell
./dataset\d01-118-s01-01.png,whether or not a particular text was written on
./dataset\d01-118-s01-02.png,a roll or a codex .
./dataset\d01-118-s02-00.png,Rolls were prepared for
./dataset\d01-118-s02-01.png,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
./dataset\d01-118-s02-02.png,end could be cut off .
./dataset\d01-118-s03-00.png,If the text was longer than
./dataset\d01-118-s03-01.png,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
./dataset\d01-123-s00-00.png,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"
./dataset\d01-123-s00-01.png,"cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,"
./dataset\d01-123-s00-02.png,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
./dataset\d01-123-s00-03.png,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
./dataset\d01-123-s01-00.png,The codex form was not so accommodating .
./dataset\d01-123-s02-00.png,Even
./dataset\d01-123-s02-01.png,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
./dataset\d01-123-s02-02.png,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
./dataset\d01-123-s02-03.png,"over the binding , or the whole codex rebound ."

./dataset\d05-030-s00-01.png,now so much nobler a figure than former historians
./dataset\d05-030-s00-02.png,led us to believe .
./dataset\d05-030-s01-00.png,Laud was enthusiastically hated

./dataset\d05-030-s03-00.png,One of his

./dataset\d05-030-s04-00.png,But anyone who was friendly
./dataset\d05-030-s04-01.png,"with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,"
./dataset\d05-030-s04-02.png,was necessarily a menace .
./dataset\d05-040-s01-00.png,Laud made a positive approach .
./dataset\d05-040-s02-00.png,He set out to increase
./dataset\d05-040-s02-01.png,a sense of reverence .
./dataset\d05-040-s03-00.png,The Prayer Book was to be respected
./dataset\d05-040-s03-01.png,and so was the office of a bishop .
./dataset\d05-040-s04-00.png,Altars should be
./dataset\d05-040-s04-01.png,"altars and not any broken down , transportable"
./dataset\d05-040-s04-02.png,table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
./dataset\d06-000-s00-00.png,In the first place it is not a great deal
./dataset\d06-000-s00-01.png,"of use telling even children , as I have"
./dataset\d06-000-s00-02.png,"already suggested , not to be silly or"
./dataset\d06-000-s00-03.png,to pull themselves together .
./dataset\d06-000-s01-00.png,Far better
./dataset\d06-000-s01-01.png,to help them to face whatever it is that
./dataset\d06-000-s01-02.png,"is worrying them , to find the original"
./dataset\d06-000-s01-03.png,cause and then deal with it ; show it
./dataset\d06-000-s01-04.png,up either for the sham it is - and many
./dataset\d06-000-s01-05.png,fears are based upon completely
./dataset\d06-000-s01-06.png,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
./dataset\d06-003-s00-00.png,Even worse is to laugh .
./dataset\d06-003-s01-00.png,Tremendous damage may be done to a child
./dataset\d06-003-s01-01.png,by laughing at what are very real fears .

./dataset\d06-003-s02-01.png,"that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,"
./dataset\d06-003-s02-02.png,but to a child they are very real .
./dataset\d06-003-s03-00.png,Not that I am suggesting
./dataset\d06-003-s03-01.png,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
./dataset\d06-003-s03-02.png,"to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the"
./dataset\d06-003-s03-03.png,other side as victors .
./dataset\d06-008-s00-00.png,To ridicule them only pushes them farther
./dataset\d06-008-s00-01.png,"into themselves , so that they become"
./dataset\d06-008-s00-02.png,unable to speak about it to anybody and
./dataset\d06-008-s00-03.png,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,"
./dataset\d06-008-s00-04.png,the harvest of which may still be being
./dataset\d06-008-s00-05.png,reaped at forty or fifty .
./dataset\d06-008-s01-00.png,Far better to
./dataset\d06-008-s01-01.png,agree with a child that a particular
./dataset\d06-008-s01-02.png,"situation is frightening , and then to face"
./dataset\d06-008-s01-03.png,it together until the child can see how
./dataset\d06-008-s01-04.png,unnecessary its fears were .
./dataset\d06-011-s00-00.png,Because situations which may contain
./dataset\d06-011-s00-01.png,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
./dataset\d06-011-s00-02.png,it is a good idea to condition a child
./dataset\d06-011-s00-03.png,to some extent against it .
./dataset\d06-011-s01-00.png,To keep a child
./dataset\d06-011-s01-01.png,of twelve or thirteen under the
./dataset\d06-011-s01-02.png,impression that nothing nasty ever
./dataset\d06-011-s01-03.png,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
./dataset\d06-011-s01-04.png,is unwise .
./dataset\d06-011-s02-00.png,As I shall suggest in a
./dataset\d06-011-s02-01.png,later chapter there are some situations
./dataset\d06-011-s02-02.png,which occur less frequently than
./dataset\d06-015-s00-00.png,"A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into"
./dataset\d06-015-s00-01.png,"too many details , would help many a child to make a"
./dataset\d06-015-s00-02.png,proper adjustment to life as it grows up .
./dataset\d06-015-s01-00.png,Let us look
./dataset\d06-015-s01-01.png,at Jesus .
./dataset\d06-015-s02-00.png,"We do not , I think , see there a life without fear ."
./dataset\d06-015-s03-00.png,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
./dataset\d06-015-s03-01.png,on .
./dataset\d06-020-s00-00.png,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
./dataset\d06-020-s00-01.png,should pass from Him .
./dataset\d06-020-s01-00.png,Jesus shows us
./dataset\d06-020-s01-01.png,the way to face life .
./dataset\d06-020-s02-00.png,To see all the latent
./dataset\d06-020-s02-01.png,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
./dataset\d06-020-s02-02.png,them and knowing God is with us and
./dataset\d06-020-s02-03.png,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
./dataset\d06-020-s02-04.png,finally defeat us .
./dataset\d06-020-s03-00.png,"More than that , that God"

./dataset\d06-020-s03-03.png,the stronger we become .

./dataset\d06-030-s02-00.png,The cure for which is sleep .
./dataset\d06-030-s03-00.png,This is only
./dataset\d06-030-s03-01.png,partly true .
./dataset\d06-030-s04-00.png,Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
./dataset\d06-030-s04-01.png,amount of rest seems to make any difference .
./dataset\d06-030-s05-00.png,"Sleep , to be"
./dataset\d06-030-s05-01.png,"effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes"
./dataset\d06-037-s00-00.png,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
./dataset\d06-037-s00-01.png,only a disturbed tossing and turning
./dataset\d06-037-s00-02.png,which causes them to wake feeling worse
./dataset\d06-037-s00-03.png,than when they went to bed .
./dataset\d06-037-s01-00.png,We may begin
./dataset\d06-037-s01-01.png,to understand this a little better when we
./dataset\d06-037-s01-02.png,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
./dataset\d06-037-s01-03.png,the mind .
./dataset\d06-037-s02-00.png,"Very few people , under normal"
./dataset\d06-037-s02-01.png,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
./dataset\d06-041-s00-00.png,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
./dataset\d06-041-s00-01.png,of tiredness to the body .
./dataset\d06-041-s01-00.png,This can be proved by
./dataset\d06-041-s01-01.png,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
./dataset\d06-041-s01-02.png,body who feels thoroughly tired .

./dataset\d06-046-s00-01.png,to different situations .
./dataset\d06-046-s01-00.png,There are some which
./dataset\d06-046-s01-01.png,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
./dataset\d06-046-s01-02.png,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
./dataset\d06-046-s01-04.png,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
./dataset\d06-046-s01-05.png,veritable surge of energy .
./dataset\d06-046-s02-00.png,Many a girl who
./dataset\d06-046-s02-02.png,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
./dataset\d06-046-s02-03.png,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
./dataset\d06-050-s00-00.png,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful .
./dataset\d06-050-s01-00.png,She really did feel tired
./dataset\d06-050-s01-01.png,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an

./dataset\d06-050-s02-00.png,"Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do"
./dataset\d06-050-s02-01.png,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion .
./dataset\d06-050-s03-00.png,A
./dataset\d06-050-s03-01.png,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense

./dataset\d06-050-s04-01.png,even if they do sleep .
./dataset\d06-056-s00-01.png,a burden to their families and their friends .
./dataset\d06-056-s01-00.png,Any mental confusion can cause this and

./dataset\d07-093-s00-03.png,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
./dataset\d07-093-s01-00.png,This can either mean that both sugyas are

./dataset\e01-050-s03-00.png,During
./dataset\e01-050-s03-01.png,the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
./dataset\e01-050-s03-02.png,greatly abused .
./dataset\e01-055-s00-00.png,One can remember with horror the pictures of the

./dataset\e01-055-s00-02.png,"complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-"

./dataset\e01-055-s00-04.png,numerous other crocheted pieces .
./dataset\e01-055-s01-00.png,It was some years
./dataset\e01-055-s01-01.png,after the Victorian period that designers realised
./dataset\e01-055-s01-02.png,"the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was"
./dataset\e01-055-s01-03.png,revived with designs suitable for contemporary
./dataset\e01-055-s01-04.png,trends .
./dataset\e01-055-s02-00.png,"Crochet today has a variety of uses , and"
./dataset\e01-055-s02-01.png,has even stepped into the field of high fashion .

./dataset\e01-062-s00-02.png,from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
./dataset\e01-062-s00-03.png,functions .
./dataset\e01-062-s01-00.png,The art of crochet is not difficult and
./dataset\e01-062-s01-01.png,it is reasonably quick to work .
./dataset\e01-062-s02-00.png,In the following
./dataset\e01-062-s02-01.png,pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
./dataset\e01-062-s02-02.png,to enable the beginner to master all the essential
./dataset\e01-062-s02-03.png,crochet stitches .
./dataset\e01-081-s00-00.png,First launder crochet and then pin to the required

./dataset\e01-081-s02-00.png,Run a line of basting stitches
./dataset\e01-081-s02-01.png,on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
./dataset\e01-081-s02-02.png,which are to be attached to the linen .
./dataset\e01-081-s03-00.png,Remove crochet .
./dataset\e01-086-s00-00.png,Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
./dataset\e01-086-s01-01.png,the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the

./dataset\e01-092-s03-02.png,thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
./dataset\e01-102-s00-00.png,Remember that texture plays an important part in
./dataset\e01-102-s00-01.png,the beauty of crochet .
./dataset\e01-102-s01-00.png,The finer mercerised threads
./dataset\e01-102-s01-01.png,are more effective for the delicate designs used for
./dataset\e01-102-s01-02.png,"tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while"
./dataset\e01-102-s01-03.png,"the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,"

./dataset\e01-107-s02-00.png,These are the
./dataset\e01-107-s02-01.png,correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet :
./dataset\e01-107-s03-00.png,Directions are given for a small practice

./dataset\e01-107-s04-00.png,When
./dataset\e01-107-s04-01.png,you have become proficient in these
./dataset\e01-107-s04-02.png,"stitches , attractive articles can be made"
./dataset\e01-107-s04-03.png,from the directions included in this book .
./dataset\e01-113-s00-00.png,1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
./dataset\e01-113-s00-01.png,and forefinger .

./dataset\e01-119-s00-01.png,thread .
./dataset\e01-119-s01-00.png,Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) .
./dataset\e01-119-s02-00.png,Draw loop through .

./dataset\e01-119-s03-01.png,from thread .
./dataset\e01-119-s04-00.png,Pull short end and ball thread
./dataset\e01-119-s04-01.png,in opposite directions to bring loop close around
./dataset\e01-119-s04-02.png,"the end of the hook , but not too tight"

./dataset\e01-119-s05-01.png,across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) .
./dataset\e02-000-s00-00.png,A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
./dataset\e02-000-s00-01.png,"legs , and in reproduction period pieces they"
./dataset\e02-000-s00-02.png,are frequently used .
./dataset\e02-000-s01-00.png,The simpler varieties are
./dataset\e02-000-s01-01.png,"extremely easy to work , the four sides being"
./dataset\e02-000-s02-01.png,"the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is"
./dataset\e02-000-s02-02.png,"worked in the solid , and this certainly"
./dataset\e02-000-s02-03.png,complicates the operation .
./dataset\e02-014-s00-00.png,For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
./dataset\e02-014-s01-00.png,The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
./dataset\e02-014-s01-01.png,"on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated"
./dataset\e02-014-s01-02.png,as before .
./dataset\e02-014-s02-00.png,It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
./dataset\e02-014-s02-02.png,of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
./dataset\e02-018-s00-00.png,A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
./dataset\e02-018-s00-01.png,end reveals when the required amount
./dataset\e02-018-s00-02.png,"has been removed , and if care is taken"
./dataset\e02-018-s00-03.png,to stop the plane short of the squared
./dataset\e02-018-s00-04.png,"pencil line at the top , the work will be"
./dataset\e02-018-s00-05.png,accurate .
./dataset\e02-018-s01-00.png,The straight-edge can be used
./dataset\e02-018-s01-01.png,to test the straightness of the sides .
./dataset\e02-021-s00-00.png,"Incidentally , it is better to"
./dataset\e02-021-s01-02.png,the outer surfaces being vertical as
./dataset\e02-021-s01-03.png,"at ( B ) , Fig. 1 ."
./dataset\e02-021-s02-00.png,To make a leg such as
./dataset\e02-025-s00-00.png,Note that squared lines marking
./dataset\e02-025-s00-01.png,the top member of the toe are
./dataset\e02-025-s00-02.png,needed as well as the upper ex-
./dataset\e02-025-s00-03.png,"tent of the taper , and in"
./dataset\e02-025-s00-04.png,this case it is necessary to
./dataset\e02-025-s00-05.png,mark in the line of the taper
./dataset\e02-025-s00-06.png,with pencil and straight-edge
./dataset\e02-025-s01-01.png,made at the upper toe line
./dataset\e02-025-s01-02.png,"exactly down to the taper line ,"
./dataset\e02-025-s01-03.png,no farther .
./dataset\e02-074-s01-01.png,are many reasons .
./dataset\e02-074-s02-00.png,Wood is in good and
./dataset\e02-074-s02-01.png,common supply ; it lends itself to making
./dataset\e02-074-s02-02.png,innumerable useful household items -
./dataset\e02-074-s02-03.png,"furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;"
./dataset\e02-074-s02-04.png,it enables results to be obtained fairly
./dataset\e02-074-s02-05.png,quickly ; it is less expensive than most
./dataset\e02-074-s02-06.png,other materials ; it is a pleasant material
./dataset\e02-074-s02-08.png,"create a certain amount of mess , it is"
./dataset\e02-074-s02-09.png,all clean and easily cleared away .
./dataset\e02-082-s00-00.png,This last point is certainly important because almost
./dataset\e02-082-s00-02.png,"are not only an economic necessity , but that a"
./dataset\e02-082-s00-03.png,great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
./dataset\e02-082-s01-02.png,ripping out parts from hardwood .
./dataset\e02-082-s02-00.png,Most men
./dataset\e02-082-s02-01.png,would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
./dataset\e02-086-s00-00.png,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin"
./dataset\e02-086-s00-01.png,with what we have called a bare minimum kit .
./dataset\e02-086-s01-00.png,Probably
./dataset\e02-086-s01-01.png,most men have some of the tools already .
./dataset\e02-086-s02-00.png,It will enable
./dataset\e02-086-s02-01.png,"a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in"
./dataset\e02-086-s02-02.png,any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
./dataset\e02-086-s02-03.png,which other tools can be added as the need arises .
./dataset\e02-086-s03-00.png,The
./dataset\e02-086-s03-01.png,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
./dataset\e02-086-s03-02.png,"to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit"
./dataset\e02-086-s03-03.png,which increases the range of things that can be
./dataset\e02-086-s03-04.png,made enormously .
./dataset\e02-091-s00-00.png,"As a still further development , we follow"
./dataset\e02-091-s00-01.png,"with a good basic kit , which includes"
./dataset\e02-091-s01-00.png,With this the vast majority of jobs
./dataset\e02-091-s01-01.png,"can be done , though for advanced"
./dataset\e02-091-s01-02.png,cabinet work the necessity for
./dataset\e02-091-s01-03.png,certain special tools will become
./dataset\e02-091-s01-04.png,obvious .
./dataset\e02-094-s00-00.png,"Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and"
./dataset\e02-094-s00-01.png,"machines , the choice of which will"
./dataset\e02-094-s00-02.png,depend partly upon the space available
./dataset\e02-094-s00-03.png,"in the workshop , the amount one"
./dataset\e02-094-s00-04.png,"is prepared to pay , and the type of"
./dataset\e02-094-s00-05.png,work a man normally does .
./dataset\e02-094-s01-00.png,"First ,"
./dataset\e02-094-s01-01.png,"however , a word of advice generally ."
./dataset\e02-094-s02-00.png,Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
./dataset\e02-094-s02-01.png,machines .
./dataset\e02-094-s03-00.png,They never are cheap in the
./dataset\e02-094-s03-01.png,long run .
./dataset\e02-094-s04-00.png,"They may be inaccurate ,"
./dataset\e02-100-s00-00.png,"Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults"
./dataset\e02-100-s00-01.png,in design or quality soon become apparent .
./dataset\e02-100-s01-00.png,It is far
./dataset\e02-100-s01-01.png,better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
./dataset\e02-100-s02-00.png,"To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow"
./dataset\e02-100-s02-01.png,yourself to blame the tools when the job does
./dataset\e02-100-s02-02.png,not turn out quite right !
./dataset\e02-117-s00-00.png,Many men with only limited accommodation
./dataset\e02-117-s00-01.png,have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
./dataset\e02-117-s01-00.png,"Providing this is sound , some perfectly good"

./dataset\e04-000-s01-00.png,Unlike many
./dataset\e04-000-s01-01.png,"commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and"
./dataset\e04-000-s01-02.png,capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the

./dataset\e04-000-s02-00.png,Almost any available
./dataset\e04-000-s02-01.png,timber can be used but Parana pine is
./dataset\e04-000-s02-02.png,"recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and"
./dataset\e04-000-s02-03.png,taking a good finish .
./dataset\e04-004-s00-00.png,Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
./dataset\e04-004-s00-01.png,timber as shown in Fig. 1 .
./dataset\e04-004-s01-00.png,Although the timber will have already

./dataset\e04-004-s01-02.png,"a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters"
./dataset\e04-004-s01-03.png,will show up after painting .
./dataset\e04-004-s02-00.png,The dimensions given enable the

./dataset\e04-043-s00-01.png,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
./dataset\e04-043-s00-02.png,sold .
./dataset\e04-043-s01-00.png,It is especially designed for simplicity in
./dataset\e04-043-s01-01.png,"construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,"
./dataset\e04-043-s01-02.png,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft.
./dataset\e04-043-s02-00.png,She
./dataset\e04-043-s02-01.png,weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
./dataset\e04-043-s02-02.png,and an outboard motor with a comfortable
./dataset\e04-043-s02-03.png,margin of freeboard .
./dataset\e04-052-s00-00.png,"For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails"
./dataset\e04-052-s00-01.png,in place of screws .
./dataset\e04-052-s01-00.png,We just bend them over and clamp
./dataset\e04-052-s02-01.png,"always used brass screws , which are more expensive ."
./dataset\e04-052-s03-00.png,The first
./dataset\e04-052-s04-02.png,"is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked"
./dataset\e04-052-s04-03.png,and cut to shape later .
./dataset\e04-058-s00-00.png,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
./dataset\e04-058-s00-01.png,"the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in"
./dataset\e04-058-s00-02.png,Fig. 2 .
./dataset\e04-058-s01-00.png,The main idea is to have the moulds standing as

./dataset\e04-058-s02-00.png,For cheapness

./dataset\e04-068-s02-00.png,As will be seen from the plan
./dataset\e04-068-s02-01.png,there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
./dataset\e04-068-s03-00.png,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada

./dataset\e04-079-s01-00.png,If you have

./dataset\e04-083-s00-00.png,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
./dataset\e04-083-s00-01.png,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
./dataset\e04-083-s01-00.png,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
./dataset\e04-083-s01-01.png,to allow for the chines to rest in these
./dataset\e04-083-s01-02.png,"notches , as they are not fastened to the"

./dataset\e04-086-s02-00.png,I

./dataset\e04-086-s03-02.png,on each side .
./dataset\e04-091-s00-00.png,The chines are morticed into this and butt up
./dataset\e04-091-s00-01.png,against the transom .
./dataset\e04-091-s01-00.png,Start at the bow and
./dataset\e04-091-s01-01.png,spring them both at the same time over the
./dataset\e04-091-s01-02.png,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
./dataset\e04-091-s01-03.png,cut for this purpose in the stern or after
./dataset\e04-095-s00-00.png,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,"
./dataset\e04-095-s00-01.png,and this is the time to check before making fast
./dataset\e04-095-s00-02.png,to see that nothing is distorted .
./dataset\e04-095-s01-00.png,Ensure that
./dataset\e04-095-s01-01.png,the outside measurements from transom to transom
./dataset\e04-095-s01-02.png,are equal on each side and that the transoms
./dataset\e04-095-s01-03.png,are parallel horizontally .
./dataset\e04-095-s02-00.png,Next bevel the chines
./dataset\e04-095-s02-01.png,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
./dataset\e04-099-s00-00.png,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
./dataset\e04-099-s00-01.png,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
./dataset\e04-099-s00-02.png,planing after fixing to the boat .
./dataset\e04-099-s01-00.png,Use your two
./dataset\e04-099-s01-01.png,lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this

./dataset\e04-099-s01-03.png,the other .
./dataset\e04-099-s02-00.png,If care is taken not to waste the
./dataset\e04-099-s02-01.png,"ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts ."
./dataset\e04-103-s00-00.png,"Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready"
./dataset\e04-103-s00-01.png,to plank the sides .
./dataset\e04-103-s01-00.png,"Start again at the bows ,"
./dataset\e04-103-s02-01.png,round the frame to the stern and clamp there .
./dataset\e04-103-s03-00.png,If
./dataset\e04-103-s03-01.png,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
./dataset\e04-103-s03-02.png,well .
./dataset\e04-103-s04-00.png,"After generously covering with glue , screw"
./dataset\e04-103-s04-01.png,the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
./dataset\e04-109-s00-00.png,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
./dataset\e04-109-s00-01.png,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if"
./dataset\e04-109-s00-02.png,you are doing it that way .
./dataset\e04-109-s01-00.png,Use flat head screws
./dataset\e04-109-s01-02.png,the 1/4 in. ply .
./dataset\e04-109-s02-00.png,Make a very small hole for
./dataset\e04-109-s02-01.png,the screw to allow for a good grip .
./dataset\e04-109-s03-00.png,Remember
./dataset\e04-109-s03-01.png,to glue before screwing .
./dataset\e04-114-s00-00.png,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,"
./dataset\e04-114-s01-01.png,trifle ; this can be cleaned up later .
./dataset\e04-114-s02-00.png,As you are
./dataset\e04-114-s02-01.png,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
./dataset\e04-114-s02-02.png,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
./dataset\e04-114-s02-03.png,the screws .
./dataset\e04-114-s03-00.png,I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
./dataset\e04-114-s03-01.png,"the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and"
./dataset\e04-114-s03-02.png,the bottom shaped transom facing .
./dataset\e04-119-s01-01.png,the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
./dataset\e04-119-s01-02.png,the moulds .
./dataset\e04-119-s02-00.png,"You won't want them again for this boat , so"
./dataset\e04-119-s02-01.png,shift them right out of the way .
./dataset\e04-119-s03-00.png,Place the boat right side
./dataset\e04-119-s03-01.png,up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
./dataset\e04-124-s00-01.png,taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
./dataset\e04-124-s00-02.png,with vertical members as shown in the plans .
./dataset\e04-124-s01-00.png,Make the
./dataset\e04-124-s01-02.png,before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
./dataset\e04-124-s01-04.png,one to fit the block .
./dataset\e04-127-s00-00.png,I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
./dataset\e04-127-s00-01.png,with copper nails and roves .
./dataset\e04-127-s01-00.png,It greatly improves the
./dataset\e04-127-s02-01.png,undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
./dataset\e04-127-s03-00.png,WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
./dataset\e04-127-s03-01.png,into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
./dataset\e04-132-s00-00.png,While these may ultimately be made into a picture
./dataset\e04-132-s00-01.png,"for framing and hanging on a wall , they may"
./dataset\e04-132-s00-02.png,"also be arranged into a design , and the"
./dataset\e04-132-s00-03.png,resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
./dataset\e04-132-s00-04.png,article .
./dataset\e06-000-s00-00.png,This could hardly happen without the
./dataset\e06-000-s00-01.png,herring having some orientation with the
./dataset\e06-000-s00-02.png,sea bottom .
./dataset\e06-000-s01-00.png,It means that the crowding
./dataset\e06-000-s01-01.png,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
./dataset\e06-000-s01-02.png,the herring must continue to migrate over
./dataset\e06-000-s01-03.png,the ground as well as in midwater and
./dataset\e06-000-s01-04.png,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
./dataset\e06-003-s00-00.png,Thus we can see that herring
./dataset\e06-003-s00-01.png,"movements , although primarily"
./dataset\e06-003-s00-04.png,are also closely related to the sea-bed
./dataset\e06-003-s00-05.png,geography .

./dataset\e06-006-s00-00.png,The effect of bottom congestion due to
./dataset\e06-006-s00-01.png,the light pressure is inevitably mixed
./dataset\e06-006-s00-02.png,with that of the suitability of ground
./dataset\e06-006-s00-03.png,for spawning .
./dataset\e06-006-s01-00.png,"Both result in crowding ,"
./dataset\e06-006-s01-01.png,so there is no need to try to separate
./dataset\e06-006-s01-02.png,them - thank Heaven !
./dataset\e06-006-s02-00.png,A good picture of
./dataset\e06-006-s02-01.png,this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
./dataset\e06-006-s02-02.png,grounds from the Viking in the north down
./dataset\e06-006-s02-03.png,to the Klondykes and the Reef along

./dataset\e06-010-s00-00.png,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
./dataset\e06-010-s01-00.png,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure .
./dataset\e06-010-s02-00.png,But
./dataset\e06-010-s02-01.png,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
./dataset\e06-010-s02-02.png,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
./dataset\e06-010-s02-03.png,echo-sounders .
./dataset\e06-010-s03-00.png,Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
./dataset\e06-010-s03-01.png,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
./dataset\e06-010-s03-02.png,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
./dataset\e06-010-s03-03.png,spawning herring are always found .
./dataset\e06-015-s00-01.png,and fishing gear leads to an overall
./dataset\e06-015-s00-02.png,though somewhat dim picture .
./dataset\e06-015-s01-00.png,The details are harder still to see .
./dataset\e06-015-s03-01.png,shoals that gather at the Knoll or
./dataset\e06-015-s03-02.png,other banks are most of them
./dataset\e06-015-s03-03.png,going to travel a hundred

./dataset\e06-015-s04-00.png,Some will spawn at the
./dataset\e06-021-s00-00.png,So the arrival of any particular shoal
./dataset\e06-021-s00-01.png,fish at a certain spawning ground may
./dataset\e06-021-s00-02.png,be accidental .
./dataset\e06-021-s01-00.png,Yet there will always be some
./dataset\e06-021-s01-01.png,"that find it if enough are travelling , just as"
./dataset\e06-021-s01-02.png,the robin who gets back exactly may be
./dataset\e06-021-s01-03.png,only one among thousands who do not .
./dataset\e06-021-s02-00.png,But this southerly migration is not
./dataset\e06-021-s02-01.png,accidental .

./dataset\e06-021-s03-01.png,"the drift , it probably has a survival value"

./dataset\e06-026-s00-01.png,explains how these migrating herring
./dataset\e06-026-s00-02.png,are biased to east or west by the
./dataset\e06-026-s00-03.png,different winds .
./dataset\e06-026-s01-00.png,Strong westerlies
./dataset\e06-026-s01-01.png,are well known to bring good
./dataset\e06-026-s01-02.png,longshore fishings .
./dataset\e06-026-s02-00.png,The surface
./dataset\e06-026-s02-01.png,water that is blown offshore must
./dataset\e06-026-s02-02.png,be replaced by an underflow bringing
./dataset\e06-026-s02-03.png,with it the herring to the Norfolk
./dataset\e06-026-s02-04.png,and Suffolk beaches .
./dataset\e06-030-s00-00.png,"Easterly winds , on the other hand ,"
./dataset\e06-030-s00-02.png,recent years have shown .
./dataset\e06-030-s01-00.png,A succession
./dataset\e06-030-s01-01.png,of winds is needed for this effect of
./dataset\e06-030-s01-02.png,"course - one breeze will not do it ,"
./dataset\e06-030-s01-05.png,but quite apart from this wind effect
./dataset\e06-030-s01-06.png,there is an easterly drift special

./dataset\e06-037-s00-00.png,The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
./dataset\e06-037-s00-01.png,has always differed from that of the

./dataset\e06-049-s00-00.png,Let us consider first what would
./dataset\e06-049-s00-01.png,appear to be the simplest case -
./dataset\e06-049-s00-02.png,that of flat fish on the bottom .
./dataset\e06-049-s01-00.png,The evidence suggest that the fish are
./dataset\e06-049-s01-01.png,aware of the moving footrope before
./dataset\e06-049-s02-01.png,"it , swimming at the same speed"
./dataset\e06-049-s02-02.png,"for an unknown period of time , until"
./dataset\e06-053-s00-00.png,Then they stop swimming and are caught .
./dataset\e06-053-s01-00.png,In
./dataset\e06-053-s01-01.png,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
./dataset\e06-053-s01-02.png,happen just after the fish had risen above
./dataset\e06-053-s01-03.png,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
./dataset\e06-053-s01-04.png,"field of disturbance , or bow wave ."
./dataset\e06-053-s02-00.png,This suggests
./dataset\e06-053-s02-01.png,that the wave might be transmitted by the
./dataset\e06-053-s02-02.png,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
./dataset\e06-053-s02-03.png,was actually just off the bottom and was
./dataset\e06-053-s02-04.png,indeed passing over some fish .
./dataset\e06-070-s00-00.png,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
./dataset\e06-070-s01-00.png,And in this film the rise of the fish was
./dataset\e06-070-s01-01.png,"small , a matter of a foot or two ."
./dataset\e06-070-s02-00.png,With round
./dataset\e06-070-s02-01.png,"fish like haddock , which would hardly"
./dataset\e06-070-s02-03.png,would seem to be even more essential ;
./dataset\e06-070-s02-04.png,but more films are needed to prove this .
./dataset\e06-070-s03-01.png,essential to catch round fish whose

./dataset\e07-072-s00-00.png,DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
./dataset\e07-072-s00-01.png,"since the end of the war , clay pots are"
./dataset\e07-072-s00-02.png,still in greatest demand .
./dataset\e07-072-s01-00.png,It is mostly
./dataset\e07-072-s01-01.png,in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
./dataset\e07-072-s01-02.png,"have made headway , and although"
./dataset\e07-072-s01-03.png,numerous small clay pots are used each
./dataset\e07-072-s01-04.png,"year , they are fewer than they were 10"
./dataset\e07-072-s02-01.png,no real substitute for clay that can be

./dataset\e07-072-s02-03.png,bituminized paper pots which are used on
./dataset\e07-072-s02-04.png,commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
./dataset\e07-076-s00-00.png,The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
./dataset\e07-076-s00-01.png,brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
./dataset\e07-076-s00-02.png,"handling , the annual losses are often around"
./dataset\e07-076-s00-03.png,"10 per cent. , and where the handling and"
./dataset\e07-076-s00-04.png,"storage facilities are not too good , these"
./dataset\e07-076-s00-05.png,losses will be even greater .
./dataset\e07-076-s01-00.png,This does not
./dataset\e07-076-s01-01.png,"necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as"
./dataset\e07-076-s01-02.png,they are not quite so fragile as the
./dataset\e07-076-s01-04.png,about in quite the same way .
./dataset\e07-079-s00-01.png,definite disadvantage .
./dataset\e07-079-s01-00.png,They are fairly heavy
./dataset\e07-079-s01-01.png,and difficult things to accommodate and
./dataset\e07-079-s01-02.png,they must have some protection from severe
./dataset\e07-079-s01-03.png,"weather , which can be quite a headache in"

./dataset\e07-079-s02-04.png,half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
./dataset\e07-079-s02-05.png,from any point of view .
./dataset\e07-083-s00-00.png,Every garden boy will agree that having to
./dataset\e07-083-s00-01.png,wash clay pots is a definite factor in
./dataset\e07-083-s00-02.png,favour of their abolition ; in fact one
./dataset\e07-083-s00-03.png,young man was so wholehearted about this
./dataset\e07-083-s00-04.png,a few years ago that he made the headlines
./dataset\e07-083-s00-05.png,for having smashed a large number # to
./dataset\e07-083-s00-06.png,relieve his feelings .
./dataset\e07-083-s01-00.png,On the small-to-medium
./dataset\e07-083-s01-01.png,"establishment , it is a disagreeable chore"
./dataset\e07-083-s01-02.png,"which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,"
./dataset\e07-083-s01-03.png,whereas on larger establishments the pots
./dataset\e07-083-s01-04.png,can be sterilized or washed by machine .
./dataset\e07-086-s00-00.png,It is not easy to make an economic
./dataset\e07-086-s00-01.png,comparison between clay pots and the various
./dataset\e07-086-s00-02.png,substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
./dataset\e07-086-s00-03.png,"with luck , while the latter are often"
./dataset\e07-086-s00-04.png,expendable used only once .
./dataset\e07-086-s01-00.png,Clay pots are
./dataset\e07-086-s01-01.png,efficient and congenial containers in which
./dataset\e07-086-s01-02.png,to grow plants .
./dataset\e07-086-s02-00.png,In their proper setting they
./dataset\e07-086-s02-01.png,"are not unattractive and , in spite of"
./dataset\e07-086-s02-02.png,"their shortcomings , most gardeners have"
./dataset\e07-086-s02-03.png,a nostalgic affection for them .
./dataset\e07-090-s00-00.png,"Present-day pots are better finished , do"
./dataset\e07-090-s00-02.png,wash .
./dataset\e07-090-s01-00.png,The deep rims make for neater and
./dataset\e07-090-s01-01.png,"safer stacking , though they are still"
./dataset\e07-090-s01-02.png,expensive and still get broken .
./dataset\e07-090-s02-00.png,On the
./dataset\e07-090-s02-01.png,"other hand , there is really no replacement"
./dataset\e07-090-s02-02.png,"for the larger sizes , so they have the"
./dataset\e07-090-s02-03.png,decided advantage of being the only
./dataset\e07-090-s02-04.png,suitable container available in quantity
./dataset\e07-090-s02-05.png,for fairly large plants .
./dataset\e07-094-s00-00.png,Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
./dataset\e07-094-s00-01.png,pots for plant raising .
./dataset\e07-094-s01-00.png,These are compressed blocks of
./dataset\e07-094-s01-01.png,"compost , made in a specially devised press to"
./dataset\e07-094-s01-02.png,simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
./dataset\e07-094-s02-00.png,"Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they"
./dataset\e07-094-s02-01.png,are made of the same compost as would have
./dataset\e07-094-s02-03.png,that it is used in a slightly moister
./dataset\e07-098-s00-00.png,"Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them"
./dataset\e07-098-s00-01.png,"in the normal way , the only real difference"
./dataset\e07-098-s00-02.png,being that more of the watering is done through a
./dataset\e07-098-s00-03.png,rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
./dataset\e07-098-s00-04.png,of water .
./dataset\e07-098-s01-00.png,"First-class plants of tomatoes ,"
./dataset\e07-098-s01-01.png,"cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,"
./dataset\e07-098-s01-02.png,"celery and onions , may all be raised in soil"
./dataset\e07-098-s01-03.png,blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
./dataset\e07-098-s01-04.png,"dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,"
./dataset\e07-098-s01-05.png,lupins and numerous others .
./dataset\e07-101-s00-00.png,One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
./dataset\e07-101-s00-01.png,one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
./dataset\e07-101-s00-02.png,completely .
./dataset\e07-101-s01-00.png,Manufacturing the block and planting
./dataset\e07-101-s01-01.png,"it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,"
./dataset\e07-101-s01-02.png,"and a superior plant , which transplants more"
./dataset\e07-101-s01-03.png,"easily , is produced ."
./dataset\e07-101-s02-00.png,The obvious limitation #
./dataset\e07-101-s02-01.png,is that soil blocks can only be used for
./dataset\e07-101-s02-02.png,propagating ; there can be no progression to a
./dataset\e07-101-s02-03.png,larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
./dataset\e07-101-s02-04.png,to be moved ; it must be planted out or
./dataset\e07-101-s02-05.png,potted .
./dataset\e07-105-s00-00.png,Many amateur gardeners might improve their
./dataset\e07-105-s00-01.png,results by buying a small hand-operated soil
./dataset\e07-105-s00-02.png,block maker and use the money saved on
./dataset\e07-105-s00-03.png,buying small pots to improve their composts .
./dataset\e07-105-s01-00.png,The various types of small paper pots are very
./dataset\e07-105-s01-01.png,"useful for short-term operations , but are"
./dataset\e07-105-s01-02.png,inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
./dataset\e07-105-s01-03.png,too long .
./dataset\e07-108-s00-00.png,They are # quite useful for plants that are
./dataset\e07-108-s00-01.png,"despatched to market or direct to customers ,"
./dataset\e07-108-s00-02.png,their cheapness making them attractive to the
./dataset\e07-108-s00-04.png,in carriage costs because of their lightness .
./dataset\e07-108-s01-00.png,There are many types of plastic pots available ;
./dataset\e07-108-s01-01.png,"some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good"
./dataset\e07-108-s01-02.png,and others not so good .
./dataset\e07-108-s02-00.png,A wide range of
./dataset\e07-108-s02-01.png,plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
./dataset\e07-108-s02-02.png,usually need less water than those in clay
./dataset\e07-108-s02-03.png,pots .
./dataset\e07-112-s00-00.png,They are slightly more difficult to
./dataset\e07-112-s00-01.png,"manage , however , until a little experience"
./dataset\e07-112-s00-02.png,has been gained with them .
./dataset\e07-112-s01-00.png,Plastic pots
./dataset\e07-112-s01-01.png,"are usually more expensive than clay ones ,"
./dataset\e07-112-s01-02.png,but they are almost indestructible and

./dataset\f01-053-s03-00.png,He uses his vocabulary to

./dataset\f01-070-s01-04.png,gases and so on .
./dataset\f01-070-s02-00.png,Where has psychology got to in its
./dataset\f01-070-s02-01.png,"theories of "" mind "" ?"
./dataset\f01-070-s03-00.png,Are there any ultimate units
./dataset\f01-070-s03-01.png,of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
./dataset\f01-075-s00-00.png,At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
./dataset\f01-075-s00-01.png,be analysed into discrete bits .
./dataset\f01-075-s01-00.png,These bits were
./dataset\f01-075-s01-01.png,identified as elementary sensations .
./dataset\f01-075-s02-00.png,These were
./dataset\f01-075-s02-01.png,thought to combine together to form compound
./dataset\f01-075-s02-02.png,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
./dataset\f01-075-s02-03.png,matter combine to form molecular compounds .
./dataset\f01-075-s03-00.png,But this view led to too many difficulties and
./dataset\f01-075-s03-01.png,was finally abandoned .
./dataset\f01-075-s04-00.png,Nevertheless the search
./dataset\f01-075-s04-01.png,for basic units of mind has gone on and will
./dataset\f01-075-s04-02.png,"doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to"
./dataset\f01-075-s04-03.png,discover ultimate units .
./dataset\f01-081-s00-02.png,sciences .
./dataset\f01-081-s01-00.png,For example the success of the atomic theory
./dataset\f01-081-s01-01.png,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
./dataset\f01-085-s00-00.png,There have been many conflicting tendencies in
./dataset\f01-085-s00-01.png,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
./dataset\f01-085-s00-02.png,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
./dataset\f01-085-s02-01.png,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification

./dataset\f01-135-s02-02.png,and this feeling of queerness
./dataset\f01-135-s02-03.png,usually boils down to a quite

./dataset\g01-067-s01-05.png,and between these two extremes a graduated
./dataset\g01-067-s01-06.png,scale of payments was fixed for the
./dataset\g01-067-s01-07.png,different classes of laymen and clerics .
./dataset\g01-070-s00-00.png,Again the resentment was widespread and
./dataset\g01-070-s00-01.png,the results disappointing - a tax estimated

./dataset\g01-083-s02-00.png,The method of assessment to which the

./dataset\g01-083-s03-00.png,The manifest

./dataset\g01-088-s01-02.png,the suggestion that the rich should help
./dataset\g01-088-s01-03.png,the poor - but this was only a pious hope

./dataset\g04-007-s00-02.png,coming to Sunday Evensong .
./dataset\g04-007-s01-00.png,We managed to furnish
./dataset\g04-007-s01-01.png,"a table with cross and candles , and the people"
./dataset\g04-007-s01-02.png,appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
./dataset\g04-007-s01-03.png,as for more secular purposes .
./dataset\g04-007-s02-00.png,In 1910 Dr. Talbot
./dataset\g04-007-s02-01.png,"was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert"
./dataset\g04-007-s02-02.png,Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
./dataset\g04-011-s00-00.png,Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
./dataset\g04-011-s00-01.png,"work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and"
./dataset\g04-011-s00-02.png,to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
./dataset\g04-011-s00-03.png,Union .
./dataset\g04-011-s01-00.png,This meant organizing lectures and courses of
./dataset\g04-011-s01-01.png,"religious instruction through the Diocese , and I"
./dataset\g04-011-s01-02.png,also found myself a member of the Diocesan
./dataset\g04-011-s01-03.png,"Conference , where I remember introducing myself as"
./dataset\g04-011-s01-04.png,the incumbent of the highest church in the
./dataset\g04-011-s01-05.png,Diocese .
./dataset\g04-014-s00-00.png,There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
./dataset\g04-014-s00-01.png,"some quarters , until I explained that my church"
./dataset\g04-014-s00-02.png,was 800 feet high above the sea level !
./dataset\g04-014-s01-00.png,The
./dataset\g04-014-s01-01.png,"work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed"
./dataset\g04-014-s01-02.png,to get a stipendiary layman who could help
./dataset\g04-014-s01-03.png,among the children and young people .
./dataset\g04-017-s00-00.png,It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
./dataset\g04-017-s00-01.png,in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play .
./dataset\g04-017-s01-00.png,The place and its people were
./dataset\g04-017-s01-01.png,to play an important part in my life .
./dataset\g04-017-s02-00.png,For five years in succession till
./dataset\g04-017-s02-01.png,"war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became"
./dataset\g04-017-s02-02.png,very intimate with the people and the environs .
./dataset\g04-017-s03-00.png,Every year between the
./dataset\g04-017-s03-01.png,"Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be"
./dataset\g04-017-s03-02.png,"performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would"
./dataset\g04-017-s03-03.png,be discovered and trained .
./dataset\g04-022-s00-00.png,"After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit"
./dataset\g04-022-s00-01.png,"Germany for ten years , by which time in"
./dataset\g04-022-s00-02.png,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
./dataset\g04-022-s01-00.png,Towards the end of my five and a half years'
./dataset\g04-022-s01-01.png,incumbency I was asked if I would start
./dataset\g04-022-s01-02.png,a village choral society and conduct it .
./dataset\g04-022-s02-00.png,"This opened up a new interest , and we plunged"
./dataset\g04-022-s02-01.png,into it .
./dataset\g04-026-s00-00.png,First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
./dataset\g04-026-s00-01.png,any idea of reading music .
./dataset\g04-026-s01-00.png,This was the village doctor who was an
./dataset\g04-026-s01-01.png,old school friend at Clifton .
./dataset\g04-026-s02-00.png,He could sustain the tenor part quite well
./dataset\g04-026-s02-01.png,and lead the others .
./dataset\g04-026-s03-00.png,As for basses and altos the conductor had to
./dataset\g04-026-s03-01.png,teach by singing the parts with them .
./dataset\g04-026-s04-00.png,"It was very amusing , and by"
./dataset\g04-026-s04-01.png,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
./dataset\g04-026-s04-02.png,could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
./dataset\g04-032-s00-00.png,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
./dataset\g04-032-s00-01.png,Wedding Feast . '
./dataset\g04-032-s01-00.png,"Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we"
./dataset\g04-032-s01-01.png,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,"
./dataset\g04-032-s01-02.png,and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
./dataset\g04-032-s02-01.png,and we were all happy .
./dataset\g04-036-s00-00.png,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as"
./dataset\g04-036-s00-03.png,"who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was"
./dataset\g04-036-s00-05.png,solicitor cousin .
./dataset\g04-036-s01-00.png,As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
./dataset\g04-036-s01-01.png,"ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held"
./dataset\g04-036-s01-02.png,great family consultations .
./dataset\g04-039-s00-00.png,My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
./dataset\g04-039-s00-01.png,"his family , and found a very suitable house nearby"
./dataset\g04-039-s00-02.png,"where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926"
./dataset\g04-039-s01-01.png,at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
./dataset\g04-039-s02-00.png,"This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,"
./dataset\g04-039-s02-02.png,a close friend of ours .
./dataset\g04-043-s00-00.png,But what a change from the dear little old church
./dataset\g04-043-s00-01.png,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
./dataset\g04-043-s00-02.png,at Purley .
./dataset\g04-043-s01-00.png,"One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the"
./dataset\g04-043-s01-02.png,had been a House of Prayer .
./dataset\g04-043-s02-00.png,I could not but feel the
./dataset\g04-043-s02-01.png,"chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is ."
./dataset\g04-043-s03-00.png,When we had found a group of people who gladly
./dataset\g04-043-s03-01.png,"co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place"
./dataset\g04-043-s03-02.png,of daily prayer .
./dataset\g04-048-s00-00.png,I suggested to the congregation that it needed
./dataset\g04-048-s00-01.png,"warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we"
./dataset\g04-048-s00-02.png,found many to help .
./dataset\g04-048-s01-00.png,Gifts of candlesticks and
./dataset\g04-048-s01-01.png,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
./dataset\g04-048-s01-02.png,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
./dataset\g04-048-s01-03.png,for prayer and quiet .
./dataset\g04-048-s02-00.png,In time we received similar
./dataset\g04-048-s02-02.png,windows .
./dataset\g04-052-s00-00.png,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
./dataset\g04-052-s00-01.png,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
./dataset\g04-052-s00-03.png,"the architect , himself a fine artist ."
./dataset\g04-052-s01-00.png,It is quite possible
./dataset\g04-052-s01-01.png,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
./dataset\g04-052-s01-02.png,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
./dataset\g04-052-s01-03.png,table to the environs .
./dataset\g04-055-s00-00.png,We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
./dataset\g04-055-s00-01.png,"the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses ."
./dataset\g04-055-s01-00.png,This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
./dataset\g04-055-s01-01.png,"there , but was soon changed into the better-"
./dataset\g04-055-s02-01.png,"were lots of children there , and we had"
./dataset\g04-055-s02-02.png,a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
./dataset\g04-055-s03-01.png,more help both at the church and Mission
./dataset\g04-055-s03-02.png,district .
./dataset\g04-060-s00-00.png,The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
./dataset\g04-060-s00-01.png,"Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the"
./dataset\g04-060-s00-02.png,church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
./dataset\g04-060-s01-01.png,"1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission"
./dataset\g04-060-s01-02.png,"district and got to know , and be known by , many of"
./dataset\g04-060-s01-03.png,the people of the parish .
./dataset\g04-063-s00-00.png,A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
./dataset\g04-063-s01-01.png,"the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly"
./dataset\g04-063-s01-02.png,that one of us must volunteer .
./dataset\g04-063-s02-00.png,"The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did"
./dataset\g04-063-s02-01.png,"not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish"
./dataset\g04-063-s03-02.png,was very soon in France where he did splendid
./dataset\g04-063-s03-03.png,work until his health broke down and he had a bad
./dataset\g04-063-s03-04.png,attack of enteric fever .
./dataset\g04-068-s00-00.png,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
./dataset\g04-068-s01-00.png,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
./dataset\g04-068-s02-01.png,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
./dataset\g04-068-s02-03.png,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
./dataset\g04-068-s02-05.png,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
./dataset\g04-072-s00-01.png,"Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously"
./dataset\g04-072-s01-01.png,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
./dataset\g04-072-s01-02.png,the Committee .
./dataset\g04-072-s02-00.png,"We had a splendid body of local residents ,"
./dataset\g04-072-s03-01.png,"Committee met once a week in the evenings , and"
./dataset\g04-072-s03-02.png,included professional men from every walk of
./dataset\g04-072-s03-03.png,life .
./dataset\g04-077-s00-00.png,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
./dataset\g04-077-s00-01.png,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen .
./dataset\g04-077-s01-00.png,Life was
./dataset\g04-077-s01-01.png,in those years more than busy .
./dataset\g04-077-s02-00.png,We now had a vicarage next
./dataset\g04-077-s02-01.png,"to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight"
./dataset\g04-077-s02-02.png,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
./dataset\g04-077-s02-03.png,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
./dataset\g04-081-s00-00.png,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
./dataset\g04-081-s00-01.png,Purley she offered to come and look after me .
./dataset\g04-081-s01-00.png,She was
./dataset\g04-081-s01-01.png,"a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic"
./dataset\g04-081-s01-02.png,"things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '"
./dataset\g04-081-s01-03.png,who was the only other occupant of the house when
./dataset\g04-088-s00-00.png,We gathered together a splendid Sunday
./dataset\g04-088-s00-02.png,"being given a number which , as they came into"

./dataset\g04-088-s01-00.png,Each child had a
./dataset\g04-088-s01-01.png,picture given them and the lesson was
./dataset\g04-088-s01-02.png,largely based on this .
./dataset\g04-088-s02-00.png,It was on a
./dataset\g04-088-s02-01.png,stamp which could be stuck in
./dataset\g04-088-s02-02.png,"their book , and there was quite a"
./dataset\g04-088-s02-03.png,clamour for back stamps if a child
./dataset\g04-092-s00-00.png,It was quite amusing to see how much
./dataset\g04-092-s00-02.png,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
./dataset\g04-092-s01-03.png,it is a great joy to meet them now
./dataset\g04-092-s01-04.png,fifty years afterwards when so many
./dataset\g04-095-s00-00.png,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
./dataset\g04-095-s00-01.png,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
./dataset\g04-095-s00-02.png,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
./dataset\g04-095-s00-03.png,continuing till old age to-day .
./dataset\g04-095-s01-00.png,When I went
./dataset\g04-095-s01-01.png,"to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was"
./dataset\g04-095-s01-04.png,sons was just coming into the world in this year
./dataset\g04-095-s01-05.png,of 1913 .
./dataset\g04-098-s00-00.png,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
./dataset\g04-098-s00-01.png,deep friendship which I have taken with me through
./dataset\g04-098-s01-01.png,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
./dataset\g04-098-s01-02.png,"years of war , when most lives were upset and"
./dataset\g04-098-s01-03.png,"some tempers were easily frayed , the most"
./dataset\g04-101-s00-00.png,Their homes - for since those years they have
./dataset\g04-101-s00-01.png,lived on in Purley - have always been
./dataset\g04-101-s00-02.png,"havens of rest , and the welcome has never"
./dataset\g04-101-s00-03.png,failed .
./dataset\g04-101-s01-00.png,"Their three boys , now successful men ,"
./dataset\g04-101-s01-02.png,"outset , and when we don't see one"
./dataset\g04-101-s01-03.png,another we do not forget .
./dataset\g04-104-s00-00.png,"In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full"
./dataset\g04-104-s00-01.png,both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
./dataset\g04-104-s01-00.png,"The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in"
./dataset\g04-104-s01-01.png,"Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards"
./dataset\g04-104-s01-02.png,"at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners ."
./dataset\g04-104-s02-00.png,"I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them"
./dataset\g04-104-s02-01.png,"frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with"
./dataset\g04-104-s02-02.png,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
./dataset\g04-104-s02-03.png,someone who knew their native villages .
./dataset\g04-108-s00-00.png,I could at once notice the great antagonism
./dataset\g04-108-s00-01.png,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
./dataset\g04-108-s00-02.png,scorned these more simple country folk .
./dataset\g05-087-s00-00.png,Less than no response from the Russian side led
./dataset\g05-087-s00-01.png,one to fear that the event might well have the
./dataset\g05-087-s00-02.png,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
./dataset\g05-087-s01-01.png,the setting up among the German population of a
./dataset\g05-087-s01-02.png,"general system of "" francs-tireurs "" , to be named"

./dataset\g05-094-s00-00.png,The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
./dataset\g05-094-s00-01.png,more than a fantasy .
./dataset\g05-094-s01-00.png,Thanks to the good
./dataset\g05-094-s01-01.png,"sense of the front line soldiers , the"
./dataset\g05-094-s01-02.png,meeting of East and West was marked by

./dataset\g07-074a-s01-00.png,Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have

./dataset\k02-062-s03-02.png,"of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said"

./dataset\k04-068-s05-02.png,with a weight of misgiving .
./dataset\k04-075-s00-00.png,"She had , perhaps , demanded too much ."

./dataset\k04-075-s02-00.png,Every instinct urged her to
./dataset\k04-075-s02-02.png,to which her own had responded as it
./dataset\k04-075-s02-03.png,had responded to no other human being .

./dataset\k04-079-s02-00.png,For a brief interval
./dataset\k04-079-s02-01.png,she allowed herself the luxury of
./dataset\k04-079-s02-02.png,dreams .
./dataset\k04-079-s03-00.png,She began to imagine life at
./dataset\k04-079-s03-02.png,conversation of poets and dilettanti .

./dataset\k04-085-s00-00.png,This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a

./dataset\k04-085-s01-00.png,Lucia uttered a cry of
./dataset\k04-085-s01-01.png,alarm .
./dataset\k04-085-s02-00.png,"' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! '"
./dataset\k04-085-s03-00.png,It was true .
./dataset\k04-085-s04-00.png,Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about

./dataset\k04-093-s00-00.png,Vittoria now realized that they were outside

./dataset\k04-093-s04-01.png,stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
./dataset\k04-093-s04-02.png,averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
./dataset\k04-099-s00-00.png,Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic .
./dataset\k04-099-s01-00.png,The
./dataset\k04-099-s01-01.png,"coach now turned in another direction , towards"
./dataset\k04-099-s01-02.png,the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
./dataset\k04-099-s02-00.png,"It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields"

./dataset\k04-099-s02-02.png,"a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic"
./dataset\k04-099-s02-03.png,reminder of Rome's former greatness .
./dataset\k04-103-s00-00.png,In this region of Monti most of the public baths
./dataset\k04-103-s00-01.png,"had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the"
./dataset\k04-103-s00-02.png,breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
./dataset\k04-103-s00-03.png,the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become

./dataset\k04-106-s00-00.png,"As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria"
./dataset\k04-106-s00-01.png,could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a

./dataset\k04-106-s00-03.png,"gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal ."
./dataset\k04-106-s01-00.png,These

./dataset\k04-110-s03-00.png,What she had forgotten
./dataset\k04-110-s03-01.png,in her self-absorption in her own schemes
./dataset\k04-110-s03-02.png,was that other people were equally absorbed

./dataset\k04-115-s00-00.png,This move today was a reminder of that fact .
./dataset\k04-115-s01-00.png,Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
./dataset\k04-115-s01-01.png,"the agitated Lucia , her brain was working"
./dataset\k04-115-s01-02.png,"rapidly , and she decided that she must be"

./dataset\k04-115-s02-00.png,She became
./dataset\k04-115-s02-01.png,aware that the pace was slackening ;
./dataset\k04-119-s00-00.png,The moment had come .
./dataset\k04-119-s01-00.png,Upon the ensuing interview

./dataset\k04-119-s02-02.png,hands were damp .
./dataset\k04-119-s03-00.png,Orsini's high-crowned hat with

./dataset\k04-126-s04-01.png,"and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her"
./dataset\k04-136-s00-00.png,Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
./dataset\k04-136-s01-00.png,"Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said"

./dataset\k07-059a-s01-02.png,had never trodden .
./dataset\k07-059a-s02-00.png,He learned how to use his

./dataset\k07-059a-s02-02.png,"to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to"

./dataset\k07-067a-s00-00.png,He was having a ball !

./dataset\k07-067a-s02-00.png,She sat calmly on the bed smoking

./dataset\k07-122-s00-01.png,"and hear her breath come faster , to see"
./dataset\k07-122-s00-02.png,the slight beads of sweat come out on

./dataset\k07-122-s01-00.png,To have her twist
./dataset\k07-122-s01-01.png,in an attempt to receive a caress he was

./dataset\k07-125-s00-00.png,"Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at"

./dataset\k07-125-s03-00.png,You just wait till you teach the
./dataset\k07-125-s03-01.png,girl you really love .
./dataset\k07-125-s04-00.png,He didn't protest any more
./dataset\k07-125-s04-01.png,to say he loved her because he knew it to
./dataset\k07-125-s04-02.png,be untrue .
./dataset\k07-125-s05-00.png,Instead he said :
./dataset\k07-125-s06-00.png,Will that be
./dataset\k07-125-s06-01.png,better ?
./dataset\k07-125-s07-00.png,She nodded :
./dataset\k07-134-s00-00.png,It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those

./dataset\k07-134-s03-00.png,You lose half the fun when you
./dataset\k07-134-s03-01.png,fumble in the dark .

./dataset\k07-134-s04-01.png,comments like that .
./dataset\k07-134-s05-00.png,Once she quietly
./dataset\k07-134-s05-01.png,pushed him back when he kissed her too
./dataset\k07-134-s05-02.png,fully and too soon :

./dataset\k07-141-s02-01.png,plunged in at random ?
./dataset\k07-141-s03-00.png,He 'd learned to
./dataset\k07-141-s03-01.png,laugh when something went wrong or the
./dataset\k07-141-s03-02.png,"situation became ludicrous , as when they"
./dataset\k07-141-s03-03.png,were both caught in the raw when he 'd
./dataset\k07-141-s03-04.png,forgotten to lock his door and Derek
./dataset\k07-141-s03-05.png,had walked in unexpectedly .
./dataset\k07-146-s00-00.png,They 'd just had time to nip into the
./dataset\k07-146-s00-01.png,bathroom and stood there shivering for
./dataset\k07-146-s00-02.png,fifteen minutes while their guest was
./dataset\k07-146-s00-03.png,smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
./dataset\k07-146-s01-00.png,At last Derek got tired and left .
./dataset\k07-146-s02-00.png,"Just in time , erupted Charlie ."
./dataset\k07-146-s03-00.png,If he 'd
./dataset\k07-146-s03-01.png,stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
./dataset\k07-146-s03-02.png,have asked him to join us .
./dataset\k07-146-s04-00.png,I 'm so
./dataset\k07-146-s04-01.png,darned cold I could do with two men .

./dataset\k07-152-s01-01.png,I 'll tell you if you need help .
./dataset\k07-152-s02-00.png,Once he came back to the subject
./dataset\k07-152-s02-01.png,of her marriage and asked her why
./dataset\k07-152-s02-02.png,she was going to marry her sculptor .
./dataset\k07-152-s03-00.png,"Because I love him , of course ."
./dataset\k07-152-s04-00.png,What do you think ?
./dataset\k07-158-s01-00.png,I suppose so .
./dataset\k07-158-s02-00.png,What attracts you ?
./dataset\k07-158-s03-00.png,It can't be physical ?
./dataset\k07-158-s04-00.png,Of course
./dataset\k07-158-s04-01.png,not !
./dataset\k07-158-s05-00.png,I love him for what he is
./dataset\k07-158-s05-01.png,- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
./dataset\k07-158-s05-02.png,of him - a woman must be a bit
./dataset\k07-158-s05-03.png,scared to be really in love .
./dataset\k07-158-s06-00.png,That 's why you could never

./dataset\k07-166-s00-00.png,"Correct , ducky !"

./dataset\l04-066-s03-00.png,He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware

./dataset\l04-071-s01-00.png,She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected

./dataset\l04-082-s04-01.png,"transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering"
./dataset\l04-082-s04-02.png,as they riveted themselves on the wall .
./dataset\l04-087-s00-00.png,Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
./dataset\l04-087-s01-00.png,Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
./dataset\l04-087-s01-01.png,panel and pulled it out .
./dataset\l04-087-s02-00.png,The black tin box was exactly
./dataset\l04-087-s02-01.png,as he had left it .
./dataset\l04-087-s03-00.png,With heavily beating heart he reached
./dataset\l04-087-s03-01.png,out and lifted the lid .
./dataset\l04-087-s04-00.png,Everything was intact and he
./dataset\l04-087-s04-01.png,gasped with relief .
./dataset\l04-093-s00-00.png,He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor

./dataset\l04-093-s02-00.png,Obviously he had been careless in
./dataset\l04-093-s02-01.png,"replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having"
./dataset\l04-093-s02-02.png,discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
./dataset\l04-093-s03-01.png,box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
./dataset\l04-093-s03-02.png,cupboard .
./dataset\l04-098-s00-00.png,It would be safer under lock and key
./dataset\l04-098-s00-01.png,for the time being than behind a piece

./dataset\m01-032-s01-00.png,Her face took on

./dataset\r06-130-s00-00.png,At the entrance of the cinema the
./dataset\r06-130-s00-01.png,doorman was lying in wait for anyone
