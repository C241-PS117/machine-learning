./data/dataset\a03-034-s00-00.png,Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on

./data/dataset\a03-034-s00-02.png,which outlines in some detail the accomplishments

./data/dataset\a03-034-s01-00.png,Nevertheless there is little
./data/dataset\a03-034-s01-01.png,illusion in the Conservative Party that their

./data/dataset\d01-056-s01-01.png,version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
./data/dataset\d01-056-s01-02.png,"printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,"

./data/dataset\d01-056-s02-02.png,it is not a matter of the greatest importance
./data/dataset\d01-056-s02-03.png,which text is used .
./data/dataset\d01-060-s00-00.png,At first sight the difference between
./data/dataset\d01-060-s00-01.png,Souter and the other texts is rather
./data/dataset\d01-060-s00-02.png,large .
./data/dataset\d01-060-s01-00.png,But the British text includes
./data/dataset\d01-060-s01-01.png,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman"
./data/dataset\d01-060-s01-02.png,"taken in Adultery , and this accounts"
./data/dataset\d01-060-s01-03.png,"for 178 words out of 279 , which is"

./data/dataset\d01-060-s01-05.png,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's ."
./data/dataset\d01-060-s02-00.png,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
./data/dataset\d01-060-s02-01.png,is a matter of editorial decision rather
./data/dataset\d01-080-s00-00.png,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
./data/dataset\d01-080-s00-01.png,were also used .
./data/dataset\d01-080-s01-00.png,Dots sometimes served in place of the
./data/dataset\d01-080-s01-01.png,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
./data/dataset\d01-080-s01-02.png,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending .
./data/dataset\d01-080-s02-00.png,Frequently
./data/dataset\d01-080-s02-01.png,paragraphos markings were omitted .
./data/dataset\d01-080-s03-00.png,C. H. Roberts is of
./data/dataset\d01-080-s03-01.png,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
./data/dataset\d01-080-s03-02.png,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
./data/dataset\d01-080-s03-03.png,impossible to say .
./data/dataset\d01-085-s00-01.png,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked .
./data/dataset\d01-085-s01-00.png,The
./data/dataset\d01-085-s01-01.png,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
./data/dataset\d01-085-s01-02.png,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
./data/dataset\d01-085-s01-03.png,columns .
./data/dataset\d01-085-s02-00.png,This is the invariable practice of ancient
./data/dataset\d01-085-s02-01.png,manuscripts .

./data/dataset\d01-098-s00-00.png,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
./data/dataset\d01-098-s01-01.png,a simple and serviceable book .
./data/dataset\d01-098-s02-00.png,It was robust - the number
./data/dataset\d01-098-s02-01.png,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
./data/dataset\d01-098-s02-02.png,this - and it was easily stored .
./data/dataset\d01-098-s03-00.png,It had two disadvantages .
./data/dataset\d01-098-s04-00.png,It
./data/dataset\d01-098-s04-01.png,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
./data/dataset\d01-104-s00-00.png,This last objection might have had some weight in
./data/dataset\d01-104-s00-01.png,ecclesiastical circles .
./data/dataset\d01-104-s01-00.png,"In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
./data/dataset\d01-104-s01-01.png,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
./data/dataset\d01-104-s02-00.png,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
./data/dataset\d01-104-s02-01.png,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
./data/dataset\d01-104-s02-02.png,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
./data/dataset\d01-104-s03-00.png,The other form of book was the codex .
./data/dataset\d01-104-s04-00.png,In this the
./data/dataset\d01-104-s04-01.png,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
./data/dataset\d01-118-s00-00.png,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
./data/dataset\d01-118-s00-01.png,might be bulky .
./data/dataset\d01-118-s01-00.png,It is sometimes possible to tell
./data/dataset\d01-118-s01-01.png,whether or not a particular text was written on
./data/dataset\d01-118-s01-02.png,a roll or a codex .
./data/dataset\d01-118-s02-00.png,Rolls were prepared for
./data/dataset\d01-118-s02-01.png,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
./data/dataset\d01-118-s02-02.png,end could be cut off .
./data/dataset\d01-118-s03-00.png,If the text was longer than
./data/dataset\d01-118-s03-01.png,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
./data/dataset\d01-123-s00-00.png,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"

./data/dataset\d01-123-s00-02.png,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
./data/dataset\d01-123-s00-03.png,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
./data/dataset\d01-123-s01-00.png,The codex form was not so accommodating .
./data/dataset\d01-123-s02-00.png,Even
./data/dataset\d01-123-s02-01.png,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
./data/dataset\d01-123-s02-02.png,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on

./data/dataset\d05-040-s02-00.png,He set out to increase
./data/dataset\d05-040-s02-01.png,a sense of reverence .
./data/dataset\d05-040-s03-00.png,The Prayer Book was to be respected
./data/dataset\d05-040-s03-01.png,and so was the office of a bishop .

./data/dataset\d06-003-s01-00.png,Tremendous damage may be done to a child

./data/dataset\d06-003-s03-00.png,Not that I am suggesting

./data/dataset\d06-008-s01-04.png,unnecessary its fears were .
./data/dataset\d06-011-s00-00.png,Because situations which may contain
./data/dataset\d06-011-s00-01.png,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
./data/dataset\d06-011-s00-02.png,it is a good idea to condition a child
./data/dataset\d06-011-s00-03.png,to some extent against it .
./data/dataset\d06-011-s01-00.png,To keep a child
./data/dataset\d06-011-s01-01.png,of twelve or thirteen under the
./data/dataset\d06-011-s01-02.png,impression that nothing nasty ever
./data/dataset\d06-011-s01-03.png,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
./data/dataset\d06-011-s01-04.png,is unwise .
./data/dataset\d06-011-s02-00.png,As I shall suggest in a
./data/dataset\d06-011-s02-01.png,later chapter there are some situations
./data/dataset\d06-011-s02-02.png,which occur less frequently than

./data/dataset\d06-015-s00-01.png,"too many details , would help many a child to make a"
./data/dataset\d06-015-s00-02.png,proper adjustment to life as it grows up .
./data/dataset\d06-015-s01-00.png,Let us look
./data/dataset\d06-015-s01-01.png,at Jesus .
./data/dataset\d06-015-s02-00.png,"We do not , I think , see there a life without fear ."
./data/dataset\d06-015-s03-00.png,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
./data/dataset\d06-015-s03-01.png,on .
./data/dataset\d06-020-s00-00.png,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
./data/dataset\d06-020-s00-01.png,should pass from Him .
./data/dataset\d06-020-s01-00.png,Jesus shows us
./data/dataset\d06-020-s01-01.png,the way to face life .
./data/dataset\d06-020-s02-00.png,To see all the latent
./data/dataset\d06-020-s02-01.png,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
./data/dataset\d06-020-s02-02.png,them and knowing God is with us and
./data/dataset\d06-020-s02-03.png,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
./data/dataset\d06-020-s02-04.png,finally defeat us .
./data/dataset\d06-020-s03-00.png,"More than that , that God"

./data/dataset\d06-020-s03-02.png,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,"
./data/dataset\d06-020-s03-03.png,the stronger we become .
./data/dataset\d06-025-s00-02.png,Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in

./data/dataset\d06-030-s01-00.png,MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
./data/dataset\d06-030-s01-01.png,purely physical thing .
./data/dataset\d06-030-s02-00.png,The cure for which is sleep .
./data/dataset\d06-030-s03-00.png,This is only
./data/dataset\d06-030-s03-01.png,partly true .
./data/dataset\d06-030-s04-00.png,Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
./data/dataset\d06-030-s04-01.png,amount of rest seems to make any difference .
./data/dataset\d06-030-s05-00.png,"Sleep , to be"
./data/dataset\d06-030-s05-01.png,"effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes"
./data/dataset\d06-037-s00-00.png,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
./data/dataset\d06-037-s00-01.png,only a disturbed tossing and turning
./data/dataset\d06-037-s00-02.png,which causes them to wake feeling worse
./data/dataset\d06-037-s00-03.png,than when they went to bed .
./data/dataset\d06-037-s01-00.png,We may begin
./data/dataset\d06-037-s01-01.png,to understand this a little better when we
./data/dataset\d06-037-s01-02.png,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
./data/dataset\d06-037-s01-03.png,the mind .
./data/dataset\d06-037-s02-00.png,"Very few people , under normal"
./data/dataset\d06-037-s02-01.png,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
./data/dataset\d06-041-s00-00.png,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
./data/dataset\d06-041-s00-01.png,of tiredness to the body .
./data/dataset\d06-041-s01-00.png,This can be proved by
./data/dataset\d06-041-s01-01.png,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
./data/dataset\d06-041-s01-02.png,body who feels thoroughly tired .
./data/dataset\d06-041-s02-00.png,Suppose
./data/dataset\d06-041-s02-01.png,a mother has news late at night that her
./data/dataset\d06-041-s02-02.png,child is in danger .
./data/dataset\d06-041-s03-00.png,She will undertake a
./data/dataset\d06-041-s03-01.png,"journey which , an hour before , she would"
./data/dataset\d06-041-s03-02.png,have declared impossible .
./data/dataset\d06-046-s00-00.png,"Even more simply , test your own reactions"
./data/dataset\d06-046-s00-01.png,to different situations .
./data/dataset\d06-046-s01-00.png,There are some which
./data/dataset\d06-046-s01-01.png,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
./data/dataset\d06-046-s01-02.png,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
./data/dataset\d06-046-s01-04.png,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
./data/dataset\d06-046-s01-05.png,veritable surge of energy .
./data/dataset\d06-046-s02-00.png,Many a girl who
./data/dataset\d06-046-s02-02.png,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
./data/dataset\d06-046-s02-03.png,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
./data/dataset\d06-050-s00-00.png,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful .
./data/dataset\d06-050-s01-00.png,She really did feel tired
./data/dataset\d06-050-s01-01.png,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
./data/dataset\d06-050-s01-02.png,attractive - interest !
./data/dataset\d06-050-s02-00.png,"Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do"
./data/dataset\d06-050-s02-01.png,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion .
./data/dataset\d06-050-s03-00.png,A
./data/dataset\d06-050-s03-01.png,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
./data/dataset\d06-050-s03-02.png,of fatigue .
./data/dataset\d06-050-s04-00.png,"They wonder why they get no rest at night ,"
./data/dataset\d06-050-s04-01.png,even if they do sleep .
./data/dataset\d06-056-s00-01.png,a burden to their families and their friends .
./data/dataset\d06-056-s01-00.png,Any mental confusion can cause this and
./data/dataset\d06-056-s01-01.png,the best way is probably to seek advice .
./data/dataset\d06-056-s02-00.png,As we are unable to cure our own bodies
./data/dataset\d06-056-s02-01.png,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,"
./data/dataset\d06-056-s02-02.png,"so we are unable to cure our own minds ,"
./data/dataset\d06-056-s02-04.png,involving careful and patient treatment .
./data/dataset\d06-060-s00-00.png,One of the greatest steps forward that has been
./data/dataset\d06-060-s00-01.png,made this century is the way in which illness

./data/dataset\d06-060-s00-03.png,and is in fact no differently regarded than

./data/dataset\d06-060-s01-00.png,"There is , nevertheless , a"
./data/dataset\d06-060-s01-01.png,great deal of tiredness which comes from
./data/dataset\d06-060-s01-02.png,no major complication but results from an
./data/dataset\d06-060-s01-03.png,"inability to deal with life , especially under"

./data/dataset\d07-089-s02-00.png,There is no reference to the Mishnah here
./data/dataset\d07-089-s02-01.png,because the Mishnah deals with the

./data/dataset\d07-093-s00-03.png,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
./data/dataset\d07-093-s01-00.png,This can either mean that both sugyas are

./data/dataset\d07-100-s00-03.png,"is added , not because this is at all relevant"
./data/dataset\d07-100-s00-05.png,a familiar interpretation which had

./data/dataset\e02-000-s02-03.png,complicates the operation .
./data/dataset\e02-014-s00-00.png,For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
./data/dataset\e02-014-s01-00.png,The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers

./data/dataset\e02-021-s02-00.png,To make a leg such as

./data/dataset\e02-025-s01-01.png,made at the upper toe line
./data/dataset\e02-025-s01-02.png,"exactly down to the taper line ,"
./data/dataset\e02-025-s01-03.png,no farther .
./data/dataset\e02-074-s01-01.png,are many reasons .
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-00.png,Wood is in good and
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-01.png,common supply ; it lends itself to making
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-02.png,innumerable useful household items -

./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-04.png,it enables results to be obtained fairly
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-05.png,quickly ; it is less expensive than most
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-06.png,other materials ; it is a pleasant material
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-08.png,"create a certain amount of mess , it is"
./data/dataset\e02-074-s02-09.png,all clean and easily cleared away .
./data/dataset\e02-082-s00-00.png,This last point is certainly important because almost

./data/dataset\e02-082-s02-00.png,Most men
./data/dataset\e02-082-s02-01.png,would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
./data/dataset\e02-086-s00-00.png,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin"
./data/dataset\e02-086-s00-01.png,with what we have called a bare minimum kit .
./data/dataset\e02-086-s01-00.png,Probably
./data/dataset\e02-086-s01-01.png,most men have some of the tools already .
./data/dataset\e02-086-s02-00.png,It will enable

./data/dataset\e02-086-s02-03.png,which other tools can be added as the need arises .
./data/dataset\e02-086-s03-00.png,The
./data/dataset\e02-086-s03-01.png,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions

./data/dataset\e02-100-s01-00.png,It is far

./data/dataset\e04-034-s01-00.png,Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
./data/dataset\e04-034-s02-01.png,woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
./data/dataset\e04-034-s02-02.png,"a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour"
./data/dataset\e04-034-s02-03.png,for the seat and the back which can be decorated with

./data/dataset\e04-038-s00-00.png,Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous

./data/dataset\e04-043-s00-00.png,Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
./data/dataset\e04-043-s00-01.png,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
./data/dataset\e04-043-s00-02.png,sold .
./data/dataset\e04-043-s01-00.png,It is especially designed for simplicity in
./data/dataset\e04-043-s01-01.png,"construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,"
./data/dataset\e04-043-s01-02.png,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft.
./data/dataset\e04-043-s02-00.png,She
./data/dataset\e04-043-s02-01.png,weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
./data/dataset\e04-043-s02-02.png,and an outboard motor with a comfortable
./data/dataset\e04-043-s02-03.png,margin of freeboard .
./data/dataset\e04-052-s00-00.png,"For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails"
./data/dataset\e04-052-s00-01.png,in place of screws .
./data/dataset\e04-052-s01-00.png,We just bend them over and clamp
./data/dataset\e04-052-s02-01.png,"always used brass screws , which are more expensive ."
./data/dataset\e04-052-s03-00.png,The first
./data/dataset\e04-052-s04-02.png,"is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked"
./data/dataset\e04-052-s04-03.png,and cut to shape later .
./data/dataset\e04-058-s00-00.png,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
./data/dataset\e04-058-s00-01.png,"the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in"
./data/dataset\e04-058-s00-02.png,Fig. 2 .
./data/dataset\e04-058-s01-00.png,The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
./data/dataset\e04-058-s01-01.png,"rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building"
./data/dataset\e04-058-s01-02.png,"and shaping your little craft , upside-down ."
./data/dataset\e04-058-s02-00.png,For cheapness
./data/dataset\e04-058-s02-01.png,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British

./data/dataset\e04-068-s00-00.png,I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
./data/dataset\e04-068-s01-01.png,and easy to make .
./data/dataset\e04-068-s02-00.png,As will be seen from the plan
./data/dataset\e04-068-s02-01.png,there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
./data/dataset\e04-068-s03-00.png,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada

./data/dataset\e04-079-s00-01.png,transoms to shape as in the
./data/dataset\e04-079-s00-02.png,detailed drawings .
./data/dataset\e04-079-s01-00.png,If you have
./data/dataset\e04-079-s01-01.png,a wooden floor you can use

./data/dataset\e04-079-s01-05.png,the ground or concrete floor .
./data/dataset\e04-079-s02-00.png,I
./data/dataset\e04-079-s02-01.png,use a heavy old base as in
./data/dataset\e04-079-s02-02.png,Fig. 2 .
./data/dataset\e04-083-s00-00.png,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
./data/dataset\e04-083-s00-01.png,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
./data/dataset\e04-083-s01-00.png,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
./data/dataset\e04-083-s01-01.png,to allow for the chines to rest in these
./data/dataset\e04-083-s01-02.png,"notches , as they are not fastened to the"

./data/dataset\e04-086-s02-00.png,I

./data/dataset\e04-091-s00-00.png,The chines are morticed into this and butt up
./data/dataset\e04-091-s00-01.png,against the transom .
./data/dataset\e04-091-s01-00.png,Start at the bow and
./data/dataset\e04-091-s01-01.png,spring them both at the same time over the
./data/dataset\e04-091-s01-02.png,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
./data/dataset\e04-091-s01-03.png,cut for this purpose in the stern or after
./data/dataset\e04-095-s00-00.png,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,"
./data/dataset\e04-095-s00-01.png,and this is the time to check before making fast
./data/dataset\e04-095-s00-02.png,to see that nothing is distorted .
./data/dataset\e04-095-s01-00.png,Ensure that
./data/dataset\e04-095-s01-01.png,the outside measurements from transom to transom
./data/dataset\e04-095-s01-02.png,are equal on each side and that the transoms
./data/dataset\e04-095-s01-03.png,are parallel horizontally .
./data/dataset\e04-095-s02-00.png,Next bevel the chines
./data/dataset\e04-095-s02-01.png,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
./data/dataset\e04-099-s00-00.png,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
./data/dataset\e04-099-s00-01.png,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
./data/dataset\e04-099-s00-02.png,planing after fixing to the boat .
./data/dataset\e04-099-s01-00.png,Use your two

./data/dataset\e04-103-s00-00.png,"Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready"
./data/dataset\e04-103-s00-01.png,to plank the sides .
./data/dataset\e04-103-s01-00.png,"Start again at the bows ,"
./data/dataset\e04-103-s02-01.png,round the frame to the stern and clamp there .
./data/dataset\e04-103-s03-00.png,If
./data/dataset\e04-103-s03-01.png,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as

./data/dataset\e04-103-s04-00.png,"After generously covering with glue , screw"
./data/dataset\e04-103-s04-01.png,the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
./data/dataset\e04-109-s00-00.png,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
./data/dataset\e04-109-s00-01.png,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if"
./data/dataset\e04-109-s00-02.png,you are doing it that way .
./data/dataset\e04-109-s01-00.png,Use flat head screws
./data/dataset\e04-109-s01-02.png,the 1/4 in. ply .
./data/dataset\e04-109-s02-00.png,Make a very small hole for
./data/dataset\e04-109-s02-01.png,the screw to allow for a good grip .
./data/dataset\e04-109-s03-00.png,Remember

./data/dataset\e04-114-s00-00.png,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,"
./data/dataset\e04-114-s01-01.png,trifle ; this can be cleaned up later .
./data/dataset\e04-114-s02-00.png,As you are
./data/dataset\e04-114-s02-01.png,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
./data/dataset\e04-114-s02-02.png,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
./data/dataset\e04-114-s02-03.png,the screws .
./data/dataset\e04-114-s03-00.png,I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for

./data/dataset\e04-119-s02-00.png,"You won't want them again for this boat , so"
./data/dataset\e04-119-s02-01.png,shift them right out of the way .
./data/dataset\e04-119-s03-00.png,Place the boat right side
./data/dataset\e04-119-s03-01.png,up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
./data/dataset\e04-124-s00-01.png,taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats

./data/dataset\e04-124-s01-04.png,one to fit the block .
./data/dataset\e04-127-s00-00.png,I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
./data/dataset\e04-127-s00-01.png,with copper nails and roves .
./data/dataset\e04-127-s01-00.png,It greatly improves the
./data/dataset\e04-127-s02-01.png,undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
./data/dataset\e04-127-s03-00.png,WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
./data/dataset\e04-127-s03-01.png,into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either

./data/dataset\e06-000-s00-00.png,This could hardly happen without the
./data/dataset\e06-000-s00-01.png,herring having some orientation with the
./data/dataset\e06-000-s00-02.png,sea bottom .
./data/dataset\e06-000-s01-00.png,It means that the crowding
./data/dataset\e06-000-s01-01.png,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
./data/dataset\e06-000-s01-02.png,the herring must continue to migrate over
./data/dataset\e06-000-s01-03.png,the ground as well as in midwater and
./data/dataset\e06-000-s01-04.png,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
./data/dataset\e06-003-s00-00.png,Thus we can see that herring
./data/dataset\e06-003-s00-01.png,"movements , although primarily"
./data/dataset\e06-003-s00-04.png,are also closely related to the sea-bed

./data/dataset\e06-003-s01-05.png,the herring spawn along the northern
./data/dataset\e06-006-s00-00.png,The effect of bottom congestion due to
./data/dataset\e06-006-s00-01.png,the light pressure is inevitably mixed
./data/dataset\e06-006-s00-02.png,with that of the suitability of ground
./data/dataset\e06-006-s00-03.png,for spawning .
./data/dataset\e06-006-s01-00.png,"Both result in crowding ,"
./data/dataset\e06-006-s01-01.png,so there is no need to try to separate
./data/dataset\e06-006-s01-02.png,them - thank Heaven !
./data/dataset\e06-006-s02-00.png,A good picture of
./data/dataset\e06-006-s02-01.png,this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
./data/dataset\e06-006-s02-02.png,grounds from the Viking in the north down

./data/dataset\e06-010-s00-00.png,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
./data/dataset\e06-010-s01-00.png,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure .
./data/dataset\e06-010-s02-00.png,But
./data/dataset\e06-010-s02-01.png,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
./data/dataset\e06-010-s02-02.png,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
./data/dataset\e06-010-s02-03.png,echo-sounders .
./data/dataset\e06-010-s03-00.png,Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
./data/dataset\e06-010-s03-01.png,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
./data/dataset\e06-010-s03-02.png,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
./data/dataset\e06-010-s03-03.png,spawning herring are always found .
./data/dataset\e06-015-s00-01.png,and fishing gear leads to an overall
./data/dataset\e06-015-s00-02.png,though somewhat dim picture .
./data/dataset\e06-015-s01-00.png,The details are harder still to see .
./data/dataset\e06-015-s03-01.png,shoals that gather at the Knoll or

./data/dataset\e06-015-s03-03.png,going to travel a hundred

./data/dataset\e06-015-s04-00.png,Some will spawn at the

./data/dataset\e06-021-s00-01.png,fish at a certain spawning ground may
./data/dataset\e06-021-s00-02.png,be accidental .
./data/dataset\e06-021-s01-00.png,Yet there will always be some

./data/dataset\e06-021-s02-00.png,But this southerly migration is not

./data/dataset\e06-026-s00-02.png,are biased to east or west by the
./data/dataset\e06-026-s00-03.png,different winds .
./data/dataset\e06-026-s01-00.png,Strong westerlies
./data/dataset\e06-026-s01-01.png,are well known to bring good
./data/dataset\e06-026-s01-02.png,longshore fishings .
./data/dataset\e06-026-s02-00.png,The surface
./data/dataset\e06-026-s02-01.png,water that is blown offshore must
./data/dataset\e06-026-s02-02.png,be replaced by an underflow bringing
./data/dataset\e06-026-s02-03.png,with it the herring to the Norfolk

./data/dataset\e06-030-s01-05.png,but quite apart from this wind effect

./data/dataset\e06-049-s00-00.png,Let us consider first what would
./data/dataset\e06-049-s00-01.png,appear to be the simplest case -
./data/dataset\e06-049-s00-02.png,that of flat fish on the bottom .
./data/dataset\e06-049-s01-00.png,The evidence suggest that the fish are
./data/dataset\e06-049-s01-01.png,aware of the moving footrope before
./data/dataset\e06-049-s02-01.png,"it , swimming at the same speed"
./data/dataset\e06-049-s02-02.png,"for an unknown period of time , until"
./data/dataset\e06-053-s00-00.png,Then they stop swimming and are caught .
./data/dataset\e06-053-s01-00.png,In
./data/dataset\e06-053-s01-01.png,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
./data/dataset\e06-053-s01-02.png,happen just after the fish had risen above
./data/dataset\e06-053-s01-03.png,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
./data/dataset\e06-053-s01-04.png,"field of disturbance , or bow wave ."
./data/dataset\e06-053-s02-00.png,This suggests
./data/dataset\e06-053-s02-01.png,that the wave might be transmitted by the
./data/dataset\e06-053-s02-02.png,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
./data/dataset\e06-053-s02-03.png,was actually just off the bottom and was
./data/dataset\e06-053-s02-04.png,indeed passing over some fish .
./data/dataset\e06-070-s00-00.png,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
./data/dataset\e06-070-s01-00.png,And in this film the rise of the fish was
./data/dataset\e06-070-s01-01.png,"small , a matter of a foot or two ."

./data/dataset\e07-083-s00-00.png,Every garden boy will agree that having to
./data/dataset\e07-083-s00-01.png,wash clay pots is a definite factor in

./data/dataset\e07-083-s01-03.png,whereas on larger establishments the pots
./data/dataset\e07-083-s01-04.png,can be sterilized or washed by machine .
./data/dataset\e07-086-s00-00.png,It is not easy to make an economic

./data/dataset\e07-090-s02-04.png,suitable container available in quantity
./data/dataset\e07-090-s02-05.png,for fairly large plants .
./data/dataset\e07-094-s00-00.png,Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
./data/dataset\e07-094-s00-01.png,pots for plant raising .
./data/dataset\e07-094-s01-00.png,These are compressed blocks of

./data/dataset\e07-098-s00-01.png,"in the normal way , the only real difference"
./data/dataset\e07-098-s00-02.png,being that more of the watering is done through a
./data/dataset\e07-098-s00-03.png,rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
./data/dataset\e07-098-s00-04.png,of water .

./data/dataset\e07-098-s01-05.png,lupins and numerous others .
./data/dataset\e07-101-s00-00.png,One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
./data/dataset\e07-101-s00-01.png,one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved

./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-00.png,The obvious limitation #
./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-01.png,is that soil blocks can only be used for
./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-02.png,propagating ; there can be no progression to a
./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-03.png,larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-04.png,to be moved ; it must be planted out or
./data/dataset\e07-101-s02-05.png,potted .
./data/dataset\e07-105-s00-00.png,Many amateur gardeners might improve their
./data/dataset\e07-105-s00-01.png,results by buying a small hand-operated soil

./data/dataset\e07-108-s02-00.png,A wide range of
./data/dataset\e07-108-s02-01.png,plants grow quite well in plastic pots and

./data/dataset\f01-075-s02-02.png,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
./data/dataset\f01-075-s02-03.png,matter combine to form molecular compounds .
./data/dataset\f01-075-s03-00.png,But this view led to too many difficulties and
./data/dataset\f01-075-s03-01.png,was finally abandoned .
./data/dataset\f01-075-s04-00.png,Nevertheless the search
./data/dataset\f01-075-s04-01.png,for basic units of mind has gone on and will
./data/dataset\f01-075-s04-02.png,"doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to"
./data/dataset\f01-075-s04-03.png,discover ultimate units .
./data/dataset\f01-081-s00-02.png,sciences .
./data/dataset\f01-081-s01-00.png,For example the success of the atomic theory
./data/dataset\f01-081-s01-01.png,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
./data/dataset\f01-085-s00-00.png,There have been many conflicting tendencies in
./data/dataset\f01-085-s00-01.png,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
./data/dataset\f01-085-s00-02.png,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
./data/dataset\f01-085-s02-01.png,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
./data/dataset\f01-135-s00-00.png,It is the tendency to get things
./data/dataset\f01-135-s00-01.png,the wrong way round .
./data/dataset\f01-135-s01-00.png,As a
./data/dataset\f01-135-s01-01.png,psychologist I am constantly
./data/dataset\f01-135-s01-02.png,encountering this tendency
./data/dataset\f01-135-s01-03.png,in friends and acquaintances .
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-00.png,They think there is something
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-01.png,"inevitably "" queer "" about psychology"
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-02.png,and this feeling of queerness
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-03.png,usually boils down to a quite
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-04.png,mistaken belief that the
./data/dataset\f01-135-s02-05.png,psychologist first looks into ...
./data/dataset\f01-139-s00-00.png,"This is what I mean by "" getting things the wrong way"
./data/dataset\f01-139-s01-01.png,his own mind works by looking at other people's .

./data/dataset\f01-139-s02-01.png,"as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,"
./data/dataset\f01-139-s02-02.png,nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
./data/dataset\f01-139-s02-03.png,one of the most unreliable methods of getting
./data/dataset\f01-139-s02-04.png,any precise information .

./data/dataset\f01-143-s01-02.png,person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
./data/dataset\f01-143-s01-03.png,to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
./data/dataset\f01-143-s01-04.png,this behaviour .
./data/dataset\f01-143-s02-00.png,This is no more queer than the method
./data/dataset\f01-143-s02-01.png,"of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,"
./data/dataset\f01-143-s02-02.png,and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .

./data/dataset\f01-147-s00-01.png,can nevertheless identify it .
./data/dataset\f01-147-s01-00.png,Similarly the psychologist has
./data/dataset\f01-147-s01-01.png,to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
./data/dataset\f01-147-s01-02.png,"all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they"
./data/dataset\f01-147-s01-03.png,correspond with anything in his own experience .

./data/dataset\g03-049-s00-00.png,Although his ideas were diametrically opposed

./data/dataset\g03-049-s00-04.png,"the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated"

./data/dataset\g03-052-s00-00.png,There was no abatement in political

./data/dataset\g04-003-s01-00.png,"To my amusement ,"
./data/dataset\g04-003-s01-01.png,when we met at tea at the rectory
./data/dataset\g04-003-s01-02.png,"after the Dedication , the Archbishop"
./data/dataset\g04-003-s01-03.png,said he had been stopped by
./data/dataset\g04-003-s01-04.png,a farmer in a field .
./data/dataset\g04-003-s02-00.png,He seemed
./data/dataset\g04-003-s02-01.png,"rather indignant , but we took the"
./data/dataset\g04-003-s02-02.png,episode without a smile till afterwards .
./data/dataset\g04-007-s00-00.png,"The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter"
./data/dataset\g04-007-s00-01.png,when the distance to the church deterred many from
./data/dataset\g04-007-s00-02.png,coming to Sunday Evensong .
./data/dataset\g04-007-s01-00.png,We managed to furnish
./data/dataset\g04-007-s01-01.png,"a table with cross and candles , and the people"
./data/dataset\g04-007-s01-02.png,appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
./data/dataset\g04-007-s01-03.png,as for more secular purposes .
./data/dataset\g04-007-s02-00.png,In 1910 Dr. Talbot
./data/dataset\g04-007-s02-01.png,"was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert"
./data/dataset\g04-007-s02-02.png,Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
./data/dataset\g04-011-s00-00.png,Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
./data/dataset\g04-011-s00-01.png,"work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and"
./data/dataset\g04-011-s00-02.png,to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
./data/dataset\g04-011-s00-03.png,Union .
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-00.png,This meant organizing lectures and courses of
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-01.png,"religious instruction through the Diocese , and I"
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-02.png,also found myself a member of the Diocesan
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-03.png,"Conference , where I remember introducing myself as"
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-04.png,the incumbent of the highest church in the
./data/dataset\g04-011-s01-05.png,Diocese .
./data/dataset\g04-014-s00-00.png,There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
./data/dataset\g04-014-s00-01.png,"some quarters , until I explained that my church"
./data/dataset\g04-014-s00-02.png,was 800 feet high above the sea level !
./data/dataset\g04-014-s01-00.png,The
./data/dataset\g04-014-s01-01.png,"work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed"
./data/dataset\g04-014-s01-02.png,to get a stipendiary layman who could help
./data/dataset\g04-014-s01-03.png,among the children and young people .
./data/dataset\g04-017-s00-00.png,It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
./data/dataset\g04-017-s00-01.png,in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play .
./data/dataset\g04-017-s01-00.png,The place and its people were
./data/dataset\g04-017-s01-01.png,to play an important part in my life .
./data/dataset\g04-017-s02-00.png,For five years in succession till
./data/dataset\g04-017-s02-01.png,"war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became"
./data/dataset\g04-017-s02-02.png,very intimate with the people and the environs .
./data/dataset\g04-017-s03-00.png,Every year between the
./data/dataset\g04-017-s03-01.png,"Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be"
./data/dataset\g04-017-s03-02.png,"performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would"
./data/dataset\g04-017-s03-03.png,be discovered and trained .
./data/dataset\g04-022-s00-00.png,"After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit"
./data/dataset\g04-022-s00-01.png,"Germany for ten years , by which time in"
./data/dataset\g04-022-s00-02.png,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
./data/dataset\g04-022-s01-00.png,Towards the end of my five and a half years'
./data/dataset\g04-022-s01-01.png,incumbency I was asked if I would start
./data/dataset\g04-022-s01-02.png,a village choral society and conduct it .
./data/dataset\g04-022-s02-00.png,"This opened up a new interest , and we plunged"
./data/dataset\g04-022-s02-01.png,into it .
./data/dataset\g04-026-s00-00.png,First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
./data/dataset\g04-026-s00-01.png,any idea of reading music .
./data/dataset\g04-026-s01-00.png,This was the village doctor who was an
./data/dataset\g04-026-s01-01.png,old school friend at Clifton .
./data/dataset\g04-026-s02-00.png,He could sustain the tenor part quite well
./data/dataset\g04-026-s02-01.png,and lead the others .
./data/dataset\g04-026-s03-00.png,As for basses and altos the conductor had to
./data/dataset\g04-026-s03-01.png,teach by singing the parts with them .
./data/dataset\g04-026-s04-00.png,"It was very amusing , and by"
./data/dataset\g04-026-s04-01.png,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
./data/dataset\g04-026-s04-02.png,could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
./data/dataset\g04-032-s00-00.png,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
./data/dataset\g04-032-s00-01.png,Wedding Feast . '
./data/dataset\g04-032-s01-00.png,"Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we"
./data/dataset\g04-032-s01-01.png,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,"
./data/dataset\g04-032-s01-02.png,and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
./data/dataset\g04-032-s02-01.png,and we were all happy .
./data/dataset\g04-036-s00-00.png,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as"
./data/dataset\g04-036-s00-03.png,"who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was"
./data/dataset\g04-036-s00-05.png,solicitor cousin .
./data/dataset\g04-036-s01-00.png,As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
./data/dataset\g04-036-s01-01.png,"ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held"
./data/dataset\g04-036-s01-02.png,great family consultations .
./data/dataset\g04-039-s00-00.png,My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
./data/dataset\g04-039-s00-01.png,"his family , and found a very suitable house nearby"
./data/dataset\g04-039-s00-02.png,"where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926"
./data/dataset\g04-039-s01-01.png,at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
./data/dataset\g04-039-s02-00.png,"This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,"
./data/dataset\g04-039-s02-02.png,a close friend of ours .
./data/dataset\g04-043-s00-00.png,But what a change from the dear little old church
./data/dataset\g04-043-s00-01.png,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
./data/dataset\g04-043-s00-02.png,at Purley .
./data/dataset\g04-043-s01-00.png,"One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the"
./data/dataset\g04-043-s01-02.png,had been a House of Prayer .
./data/dataset\g04-043-s02-00.png,I could not but feel the
./data/dataset\g04-043-s02-01.png,"chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is ."
./data/dataset\g04-043-s03-00.png,When we had found a group of people who gladly
./data/dataset\g04-043-s03-01.png,"co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place"
./data/dataset\g04-043-s03-02.png,of daily prayer .
./data/dataset\g04-048-s00-00.png,I suggested to the congregation that it needed
./data/dataset\g04-048-s00-01.png,"warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we"
./data/dataset\g04-048-s00-02.png,found many to help .
./data/dataset\g04-048-s01-00.png,Gifts of candlesticks and
./data/dataset\g04-048-s01-01.png,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
./data/dataset\g04-048-s01-02.png,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
./data/dataset\g04-048-s01-03.png,for prayer and quiet .
./data/dataset\g04-048-s02-00.png,In time we received similar
./data/dataset\g04-048-s02-02.png,windows .
./data/dataset\g04-052-s00-00.png,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
./data/dataset\g04-052-s00-01.png,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
./data/dataset\g04-052-s00-03.png,"the architect , himself a fine artist ."
./data/dataset\g04-052-s01-00.png,It is quite possible
./data/dataset\g04-052-s01-01.png,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
./data/dataset\g04-052-s01-02.png,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
./data/dataset\g04-052-s01-03.png,table to the environs .
./data/dataset\g04-055-s00-00.png,We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
./data/dataset\g04-055-s00-01.png,"the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses ."
./data/dataset\g04-055-s01-00.png,This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
./data/dataset\g04-055-s01-01.png,"there , but was soon changed into the better-"
./data/dataset\g04-055-s02-01.png,"were lots of children there , and we had"
./data/dataset\g04-055-s02-02.png,a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
./data/dataset\g04-055-s03-01.png,more help both at the church and Mission
./data/dataset\g04-055-s03-02.png,district .
./data/dataset\g04-060-s00-00.png,The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
./data/dataset\g04-060-s00-01.png,"Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the"
./data/dataset\g04-060-s00-02.png,church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
./data/dataset\g04-060-s01-01.png,"1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission"
./data/dataset\g04-060-s01-02.png,"district and got to know , and be known by , many of"
./data/dataset\g04-060-s01-03.png,the people of the parish .
./data/dataset\g04-063-s00-00.png,A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
./data/dataset\g04-063-s01-01.png,"the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly"
./data/dataset\g04-063-s01-02.png,that one of us must volunteer .
./data/dataset\g04-063-s02-00.png,"The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did"
./data/dataset\g04-063-s02-01.png,"not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish"
./data/dataset\g04-063-s03-02.png,was very soon in France where he did splendid
./data/dataset\g04-063-s03-03.png,work until his health broke down and he had a bad
./data/dataset\g04-063-s03-04.png,attack of enteric fever .
./data/dataset\g04-068-s00-00.png,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
./data/dataset\g04-068-s01-00.png,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
./data/dataset\g04-068-s02-01.png,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
./data/dataset\g04-068-s02-03.png,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
./data/dataset\g04-068-s02-05.png,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
./data/dataset\g04-072-s00-01.png,"Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously"
./data/dataset\g04-072-s01-01.png,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
./data/dataset\g04-072-s01-02.png,the Committee .
./data/dataset\g04-072-s02-00.png,"We had a splendid body of local residents ,"
./data/dataset\g04-072-s03-01.png,"Committee met once a week in the evenings , and"
./data/dataset\g04-072-s03-02.png,included professional men from every walk of
./data/dataset\g04-072-s03-03.png,life .
./data/dataset\g04-077-s00-00.png,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
./data/dataset\g04-077-s00-01.png,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen .
./data/dataset\g04-077-s01-00.png,Life was
./data/dataset\g04-077-s01-01.png,in those years more than busy .
./data/dataset\g04-077-s02-00.png,We now had a vicarage next
./data/dataset\g04-077-s02-01.png,"to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight"
./data/dataset\g04-077-s02-02.png,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
./data/dataset\g04-077-s02-03.png,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
./data/dataset\g04-081-s00-00.png,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
./data/dataset\g04-081-s00-01.png,Purley she offered to come and look after me .
./data/dataset\g04-081-s01-00.png,She was
./data/dataset\g04-081-s01-01.png,"a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic"
./data/dataset\g04-081-s01-02.png,"things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '"
./data/dataset\g04-081-s01-03.png,who was the only other occupant of the house when
./data/dataset\g04-088-s00-00.png,We gathered together a splendid Sunday
./data/dataset\g04-088-s00-02.png,"being given a number which , as they came into"
./data/dataset\g04-088-s00-04.png,the superintendent who filled in the regi-

./data/dataset\g04-088-s01-00.png,Each child had a
./data/dataset\g04-088-s01-01.png,picture given them and the lesson was
./data/dataset\g04-088-s01-02.png,largely based on this .
./data/dataset\g04-088-s02-00.png,It was on a
./data/dataset\g04-088-s02-01.png,stamp which could be stuck in
./data/dataset\g04-088-s02-02.png,"their book , and there was quite a"
./data/dataset\g04-088-s02-03.png,clamour for back stamps if a child

./data/dataset\g04-095-s00-01.png,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
./data/dataset\g04-095-s00-02.png,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
./data/dataset\g04-095-s00-03.png,continuing till old age to-day .
./data/dataset\g04-095-s01-00.png,When I went
./data/dataset\g04-095-s01-01.png,"to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was"
./data/dataset\g04-095-s01-04.png,sons was just coming into the world in this year
./data/dataset\g04-095-s01-05.png,of 1913 .
./data/dataset\g04-098-s00-00.png,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very

./data/dataset\g04-101-s00-00.png,Their homes - for since those years they have
./data/dataset\g04-101-s00-01.png,lived on in Purley - have always been
./data/dataset\g04-101-s00-02.png,"havens of rest , and the welcome has never"

./data/dataset\h02-004-s00-00.png,We have held eleven meetings .

./data/dataset\h02-004-s01-02.png,of organisations and persons having an interest

./data/dataset\h02-004-s02-00.png,We
./data/dataset\h02-004-s02-01.png,compiled a list of the points which we thought

./data/dataset\h02-004-s02-03.png,the replies need not be confined to these
./data/dataset\h02-004-s02-04.png,particular items .
./data/dataset\h02-008-s00-01.png,we found it an advantage in certain instances .
./data/dataset\h02-008-s01-00.png,Appendix
./data/dataset\h02-008-s01-01.png,1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted .

./data/dataset\h02-008-s02-01.png,"Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and"
./data/dataset\h02-008-s02-03.png,officers of these Departments attended our meetings
./data/dataset\h02-008-s02-04.png,and have given us valuable assistance .
./data/dataset\h02-012-s01-01.png,which arose from our terms of reference and
./data/dataset\h02-012-s01-02.png,which had been brought specially to our notice .
./data/dataset\h02-012-s02-00.png,"First , we were asked to examine the risks"
./data/dataset\h02-012-s02-01.png,attending the abuse of carbromal and
./data/dataset\h02-012-s02-02.png,bromvaletone and preparations containing these
./data/dataset\h02-012-s02-03.png,substances .
./data/dataset\h02-012-s03-00.png,The Poisons Board had already

./data/dataset\h02-012-s03-02.png,sufficient evidence that these compounds
./data/dataset\h02-017-s00-00.png,4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
./data/dataset\h02-017-s00-01.png,to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
./data/dataset\h02-017-s00-02.png,of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
./data/dataset\h02-017-s00-03.png,were not appropriate for restriction to supply on

./data/dataset\h02-024-s00-01.png,devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted

./data/dataset\h02-024-s01-01.png,ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-

./data/dataset\h02-028-s00-00.png,We were assured by our expert witnesses on this

./data/dataset\h02-028-s00-04.png,necessary precaution .
./data/dataset\h02-028-s01-00.png,We accepted this .

./data/dataset\h02-028-s02-01.png,the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
./data/dataset\h02-028-s02-02.png,anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
./data/dataset\h02-028-s02-03.png,to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be

./data/dataset\k07-125-s04-02.png,be untrue .
./data/dataset\k07-125-s05-00.png,Instead he said :
./data/dataset\k07-125-s06-00.png,Will that be
./data/dataset\k07-125-s06-01.png,better ?
./data/dataset\k07-125-s07-00.png,She nodded :

./data/dataset\k07-134-s03-01.png,fumble in the dark .
./data/dataset\k07-134-s04-00.png,She had many direct

./data/dataset\k07-134-s05-01.png,pushed him back when he kissed her too
./data/dataset\k07-134-s05-02.png,fully and too soon :
./data/dataset\k07-141-s00-00.png,"Oi , not yet , you oaf ."

./data/dataset\k07-146-s00-00.png,They 'd just had time to nip into the
./data/dataset\k07-146-s00-01.png,bathroom and stood there shivering for
./data/dataset\k07-146-s00-02.png,fifteen minutes while their guest was

./data/dataset\k07-152-s01-01.png,I 'll tell you if you need help .
./data/dataset\k07-152-s02-00.png,Once he came back to the subject
./data/dataset\k07-152-s02-01.png,of her marriage and asked her why
./data/dataset\k07-152-s02-02.png,she was going to marry her sculptor .
./data/dataset\k07-152-s03-00.png,"Because I love him , of course ."

./data/dataset\k07-158-s05-02.png,of him - a woman must be a bit
./data/dataset\k07-158-s05-03.png,scared to be really in love .

./data/dataset\k07-166-s07-01.png,about the physical side ?
./data/dataset\k07-166-s08-00.png,You 're
./data/dataset\k07-166-s08-01.png,quite an erotic little beast ; can

./data/dataset\k07-176-s02-00.png,But
./data/dataset\k07-176-s02-01.png,even if he were impotent I 'd still

./data/dataset\k07-185-s00-00.png,He often used to try to imagine

./data/dataset\k07-185-s00-02.png,"her as he did Charlie , but his"

./data/dataset\l04-071-s04-00.png,On the whole he probably

./data/dataset\l04-082-s04-01.png,"transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering"
./data/dataset\l04-082-s04-02.png,as they riveted themselves on the wall .
./data/dataset\l04-087-s00-00.png,Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
./data/dataset\l04-087-s01-00.png,Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
./data/dataset\l04-087-s01-01.png,panel and pulled it out .
./data/dataset\l04-087-s02-00.png,The black tin box was exactly
./data/dataset\l04-087-s02-01.png,as he had left it .
./data/dataset\l04-087-s03-00.png,With heavily beating heart he reached
./data/dataset\l04-087-s03-01.png,out and lifted the lid .

./data/dataset\l04-093-s01-01.png,that fifty pounds for Kitty !
./data/dataset\l04-093-s02-00.png,Obviously he had been careless in
./data/dataset\l04-093-s02-01.png,"replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having"
./data/dataset\l04-093-s02-02.png,discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
./data/dataset\l04-093-s03-01.png,box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
./data/dataset\l04-093-s03-02.png,cupboard .
./data/dataset\l04-098-s00-00.png,It would be safer under lock and key

./data/dataset\r06-103-s01-02.png,off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
./data/dataset\r06-106-s00-00.png,The day I promised to take Catherine

./data/dataset\r06-106-s02-01.png,hair had just been done .
./data/dataset\r06-106-s03-00.png,She looked
./data/dataset\r06-106-s03-01.png,more than ever like a pink and gold

./data/dataset\r06-111-s00-00.png,Catherine lives in a white house
./data/dataset\r06-111-s00-02.png,of the river .
./data/dataset\r06-111-s01-00.png,She helped me clean up my
./data/dataset\r06-111-s01-01.png,flat with a devotion which said that
./data/dataset\r06-111-s01-02.png,she felt small flats were altogether more
./data/dataset\r06-111-s01-03.png,romantic than large houses .
./data/dataset\r06-111-s02-00.png,We drank
./data/dataset\r06-111-s02-01.png,"tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,"

./data/dataset\r06-115-s00-00.png,Catherine looked at the books lying
./data/dataset\r06-115-s00-01.png,"around his room , and asked if she"
./data/dataset\r06-115-s00-02.png,might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
./data/dataset\r06-115-s00-03.png,to read on the train .
./data/dataset\r06-115-s01-00.png,Catherine is 13 .
./data/dataset\r06-115-s04-01.png,newspapers and watched her pretty
./data/dataset\r06-115-s04-02.png,frowning face as she turned the
./data/dataset\r06-115-s04-03.png,"pages of Babel , for she was determined"

./data/dataset\r06-121-s00-04.png,their bright friendly heads turned

./data/dataset\r06-121-s01-00.png,In
./data/dataset\r06-121-s01-01.png,Catherine's left hand she carried the
./data/dataset\r06-121-s01-02.png,stories of Isaac Babel .
./data/dataset\r06-121-s02-00.png,After lunch we
./data/dataset\r06-121-s02-01.png,went to the pictures .
./data/dataset\r06-121-s03-00.png,Philip allowed
./data/dataset\r06-121-s03-01.png,# it to be seen that he thought going to
./data/dataset\r06-121-s03-02.png,the pictures just for the fun of it was
./data/dataset\r06-126-s00-00.png,For his sake we chose the more
./data/dataset\r06-126-s00-01.png,serious of the two films that were
./data/dataset\r06-126-s00-02.png,showing in the little town .
./data/dataset\r06-126-s01-00.png,It was
./data/dataset\r06-126-s01-01.png,about a good priest who helped cri-

./data/dataset\r06-126-s02-02.png,of them from being sent to the gas
./data/dataset\r06-126-s02-03.png,chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
./data/dataset\r06-126-s02-04.png,Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
./data/dataset\r06-126-s02-05.png,crying and could face the light of a golden
./data/dataset\r06-126-s02-06.png,evening .
./data/dataset\r06-130-s00-00.png,At the entrance of the cinema the
./data/dataset\r06-130-s00-01.png,doorman was lying in wait for anyone
./data/dataset\r06-130-s01-01.png,"by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :"
./data/dataset\r06-130-s02-00.png,"' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be"
./data/dataset\r06-130-s02-01.png,"punished for his crime , didn't he ? '"
./data/dataset\r06-130-s03-00.png,Cathe-

./data/dataset\r06-130-s04-00.png,Philip
./data/dataset\r06-130-s04-01.png,rescued her by saying with disdain :
./data/dataset\r06-130-s05-00.png,' Some people don't know right from wrong
./data/dataset\r06-130-s05-01.png,even when its demonstrated to them . '
./data/dataset\r06-137-s00-00.png,The doorman turned his attention
./data/dataset\r06-137-s00-01.png,to the next red-eyed emerger from the
./data/dataset\r06-137-s00-02.png,dark ; and we went on together to
./data/dataset\r06-137-s00-03.png,"the station , the children silent because"
./data/dataset\r06-137-s00-04.png,of the cruelty of the world .
./data/dataset\r06-137-s01-00.png,Finally Catherine
./data/dataset\r06-137-s01-01.png,"said , her eyes wet again :"
./data/dataset\r06-137-s02-00.png,' I think its all
./data/dataset\r06-137-s02-01.png,"absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think"
./data/dataset\r06-137-s02-02.png,about it . '
./data/dataset\r06-137-s03-00.png,And Philip said :

./data/dataset\r06-137-s04-03.png,you see ? '
./data/dataset\r06-143-s00-00.png,In the train going back to London I sat
./data/dataset\r06-143-s00-01.png,beside # Catherine .
./data/dataset\r06-143-s01-00.png,She had the stories open
./data/dataset\r06-143-s01-01.png,"in front of her , but she said :"
./data/dataset\r06-143-s02-00.png,' Philip 's awfully lucky .
./data/dataset\r06-143-s03-00.png,I wish I went to that school .
